Companies that pursue sustainable development goals will receive more attention and support from these stakeholders. The pilot policy for supply chain innovation and application (SCIA) is a systemic experiment launched by the Chinese government that aims to facilitate the digitalization of supply chains and encourage companies to adopt innovative technological methods to optimize traditional supply chain management practices. Based on data from 508 manufacturing companies from 2013 to 2022, this research utilizes SCIA in the framework of a quasi-natural experiment, employing research methods DID, EM, PSM-DID, and SDID to evaluate the effect of the SCIA on SDP. Through empirical evidence, it concludes that the rollout or enforcement of the SCIA pilot policy significantly promotes SDP. SCIA impacts corporate sustainable development by increasing their intention to invest in innovation, ensuring the sustainability of corporate innovation, and reducing company cost expenditures. There is significant heterogeneity in the effectiveness of establishing pilot cities for the digitization and application of supply chain innovations: the pilot policy can significantly promote the SDP of state-owned enterprises; compared to small-scale companies, the SDP of large companies has been significantly improved due to the pilot policy; SCIA pilot policies have a greater impact on SDP of low agency cost companies than high agency cost companies; and companies located in cities with a high degree of digitalization are more favorable impacts from the pilot policy. Companies with weak monopoly power have a more significant improvement in SDP. The study enriches the research on the effectiveness of SCIA pilot policies and provides insights into how local governments can facilitate the enhancement of the SDP of manufacturing companies.","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, The race between man and machine: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment, American Economic Review, 108, 6, pp. 1488-1542, (2018); Acemoglu, Daron, Robots and jobs: Evidence from us labor markets, Journal of Political Economy, 128, 6, pp. 2188-2244, (2020); Ahi, Payman, A Quantitative Approach for Assessing Sustainability Performance of Corporations, Ecological Economics, 152, pp. 336-346, (2018); Airout, Rana M., The Moderating Role of Liquidity in the Relationship between the Expenditures and Financial Performance of SMEs: Evidence from Jordan, Economies, 11, 4, (2023); Akinade, Olugbenga O., Integrating construction supply chains within a circular economy: An ANFIS-based waste analytics system (A-WAS), Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 863-873, (2019); Alexy, Oliver T., Cui Bono?

This study explores the influence of digitalisation on the enhancement of Corporate Social Responsibility within 512 Born Global Firms (BGFs) listed on the Second-board Market during the period from 2014 to 2020. The study focuses on the extent to which digitalization contributes to corporate social responsibility, and the degree to which this impact is moderated by information disclosure and financial stability. The study employs the entropy weight method to accurately measure BGFs’ digitalisation. Moreover, both the information disclosure and financial stability exert important mediating role in bridging digitalisation and corporate social responsibility. The study designs enterprises’ information disclosure and financial stability as mediating paths and employs spatial mediating model to measure the shaping effect of digitalisation on corporate social responsibility. The digitalisation increased by 3.22%, and it had positively stimulated corporate social responsibility by 1.54% from 2014 to 2020. Enterprises’ information disclosure is identified as a significant mediator in this dynamic relationship between digitalisation and CSR to 10.34%. In contrast, financial stability did not have a significant mediating effect. The results underscore the strategic importance of leveraging digitalisation to enhance information disclosure, thereby bolstering BGFs’ CSR in response to external environmental pressures.The study provides a new perspective on embedding digital technologies into BGFs’ corporate stakeholder management and internal governance, and highlights information disclosure and corporate social responsibility through digitalisation. This study provides insights for seeking to leverage digital strategies to strengthen their corporate social responsibility stance and enhance stakeholder engagement.","Born Global Firms (bgfs); Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digitalisation; Mediating Effect","","","Adomako, Samuel, Perceived corruption, business process digitization, and SMEs’ degree of internationalization in sub-Saharan Africa, Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 196-207, (2021); Alonso-Muñoz, Sara, Technology development as a tool towards circularity: a research agenda, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 36, 2, (2023); Awaysheh, Amrou, On the relation between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 41, 6, pp. 965-987, (2020); Balon, Virendra, Mandatory corporate social responsibility and firm performance in emerging economies: An institution-based view, Sustainable Technology and Entrepreneurship, 1, 3, (2022); Caputo, Andrea, From the boundaries of management to the management of boundaries: Business processes, capabilities and negotiations, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 3, pp. 391-413, (2019); Cassetta, Ernesto, The relationship between digital technologies and internationalisation.

When job seekers gain an understanding of a company through its website, the information presented will affect their perception of the company. This study focuses on corporate social responsibility (CSR) website disclosure and examines whether the multidimensional construct of CSR information disclosed on a company’s website affects organizational attractiveness. It also investigates the moderating effect of actual CSR performance on the relationship between CSR website disclosure and organizational attractiveness. There are two levels in this study: organizational and individual. At the organizational level, 30 listed companies (in the semiconductor, electronics, and optoelectronics fields) from the Digital Times’ Top 100 Favorite Companies were selected as a sample. At the individual level, participants were invited to complete a questionnaire for data collection after viewing the target organization’s CSR website. A total of 245 students participated in this study. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for data analysis. The results show that environmental protection and energy practice disclosure is positively related to organizational attractiveness, including intention to pursue and Reputation. Employee rights and benefits on websites are also found to be positively related to organizational attractiveness, that is, intention to pursue. Inappropriate disclosure of product and service information on the CSR website can lead to suspicion among job seekers, which is detrimental to the intention to pursue. There is also a moderating effect between the organization’s actual corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance, website disclosure of CSR practices and organizational attractiveness. Previous research has predominantly focused on social responsibility activities. The findings of this study highlight the importance of web page disclosure, providing valuable insights for managerial practice and contributing to the enrichment of related theoretical literature.","","","","Ahmad, Maqsood, Intellectual capital, corporate social responsibility and sustainable competitive performance of small and medium-sized enterprises: mediating effects of organizational innovation, Kybernetes, 52, 10, pp. 4014-4040, (2023); Albinger, Heather Schmidt, Corporate social performance and attractiveness as an employer to different job seeking populations, Journal of Business Ethics, 28, 3, pp. 243-253, (2000); Amponsah-Tawiah, Kwesi, Corporate Social Responsibility in Ghana: A Sectoral Analysis, CSR, Sustainability, Ethics and Governance, pp. 189-216, (2016); Backhaus, Kristin B., Conceptualizing and researching employer branding, Career Development International, 9, 5, pp. 501-517, (2004); Multilevel Theory Research and Methods in Organizations Foundations Extensions and New Directions, (2000); Brammer, Steve J., Corporate reputation and philanthropy: An empirical analysis, Journal of Business Ethics, 61, 1, pp. 29-44, (2005); Brown, Tom J., The Company and the Product: Corporate Associations and Consumer Product Responses, Journal of Marketing, 61, 1, pp. 68-84, (1997); Hierarchical Linear Models Applications and Data Analysis Methods, (2002); Cable, Daniel M., PAY PREFERENCES AND JOB SEARCH DECISIONS: A PERSON‐ORGANIZATION FIT PERSPECTIVE, Personnel Psychology, 47, 2, pp. 317-348, (1994); Caputo, Francesco, Towards a holistic view of corporate social responsibility.

They also bear the responsibility of facilitating industrial cluster development toward zero carbon emissions, green transformation, and green innovation. Female executives, as key advocates and practitioners of low-carbon development, have a significant impact on corporate carbon performance (CCP). This study explores the effects and pathways of female executive power (FEP) on CCP using a sample of 2057 Chinese corporations. The findings show that FEP positively affects CCP by promoting corporate digital transformation (CDT) and corporate green innovation (CGI). The influence of FEP on CCP is particularly noticeable in areas with inadequate government environmental regulation, low levels of marketization, and limited public environmental awareness. However, this impact is not significant in labor-intensive small and medium-sized corporations or state-owned corporations. Further analysis reveals that there is a non-linear link between FEP and CCP. The findings emphasize the significance of FEP in corporate carbon reduction targets. The study offers suggestions for Chinese corporations that pursue sustainable development and implement low-carbon production.","","","The research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72203197, 72304124, 72003071, 72204099), National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21FJYB047, 22BZZ039), The Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Henan Province (Grant No. 2024-YYZD-05), Planning Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Henan Province (Grant No. 2024BJJ031), Research Projects on Soft Science in Henan Province (Grant No. 252400411235) and Nanhu Scholars Program for Young Scholars of XYNU.","Adams, Renée B., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?, Management Science, 58, 2, pp. 219-235, (2012); Al-Fakir Al Rabab'a, Eltayyeb, Corporate carbon performance and cost of debt: Evidence from Asia-Pacific countries, International Review of Financial Analysis, 88, (2023); Atif, Muhammad, Firm sustainable investment: Are female directors greener?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 29, 8, pp. 3449-3469, (2020); Barroso, Raúl, Board gender diversity reform and corporate carbon emissions, Journal of Corporate Finance, 87, (2024); Ben-Amar, Walid, Board Gender Diversity and Corporate Response to Sustainability Initiatives: Evidence from the Carbon Disclosure Project, Journal of Business Ethics, 142, 2, pp. 369-383, (2017); Busch, Timo, Corporate carbon performance data: Quo vadis?, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 26, 1, pp. 350-363, (2022); Caby, Jérôme, How does gender diversity in top management teams affect carbon disclosure and its quality: Evidence from the technological industry, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 199, (2024); Chen, Jie, Why female board representation matters: The role of female directors in reducing male CEO overconfidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 53, pp. 70-90, (2019); Chen, Lifang, Does digital tax enforcement drive corporate digitalization?

The understanding and transparent communication of organizational sustainability performance is a must to manage risks and identify improvement opportunities. Improvement in such aspects can be achieved through the application of the Industry 5.0 concept and its tools and methods which combine digital tools for supporting sustainable, human-centric, and resilient organizational development. By measuring organizational sustainability performance, target action can be identified in terms of prioritizing Industry 5.0 solutions that contribute to better performance. Therefore, this study provides a network and quality function deployment method-based framework that is eligible to prioritize and analyze which Industry 5.0 solution should an organization focus on to perform better on sustainability requirements. The sustainability requirements are defined based on the interlinked Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) indicators that provide transparent organizational communication and benchmarking. The QFD framework allows us to identify the cross-correlation and effects between the requirements and Industry 5.0 solutions and priorities, while its network-based analyses reveal further structural interlinkages to support the identification of the key factors of Industry 5.0 solutions.

The empirical results suggest that social security contributions have a significant positive impact on the human capital structure of enterprises, and this finding persists through a series of robustness tests. This enhancement effect can be explained by dynamic capability theory, which is primarily reflected in human resource development and technical resource optimization. The heterogeneity test indicates that the effect of social security contributions on the enhancement of the human capital structure is more pronounced in technology-intensive, non-state-owned, and small-scale firms. Furthermore, the advancement of the digital economy exerts a positive moderating effect, varying across different levels of human capital skills. The economic consequences analysis indicates that the enhancement of human capital structure due to social security contributions not only enhances corporate governance but also drives the improvement of regional industrial structure. To enhance social security contributions and optimize the human capital structure within firms, it is recommended that businesses focus on the impact of social security contributions and actively fulfill their responsibilities regarding these payments.

On one hand, automation looks at machines and how organizations enhance operational efficiency. On the other hand, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) looks at people by aligning companies with stakeholder expectations. Balancing automation and CSR often create organizational tensions since one looks at machines and another at people. However, both elements are essential for companies aiming to achieve sustainability and digital transformation in today's competitive landscape. Hitherto, no existing studies have explored how CSR and automation, viewed as paradoxical tensions, can be synergized to improve sustainability and digital transformation outcomes. This study aims to investigate the paradoxical interaction between CSR and automation, examining their joint effect on sustainability and digital transformation. The research employs an econometric analysis based on data from 402 Brazilian organizations to evaluate the influence of CSR and automation on financial, environmental, and social performances and digital transformation adoption. The findings reveal that while CSR and automation synergize to enhance environmental and social performance and the adoption of digital transformation, they have no significant effect on financial performance. However, in a post-hoc test, financial performance manifests after organizations achieve environmental, social, and digital transformation outcomes. This study provides theoretical insights into managing CSR-Automation tensions, advancing the literature on paradox theory in operations management. We offer a novel framework for reconciling the conflicting demands of CSR and automation. Simultaneously, we propose a balanced approach to achieving sustainability and digital transformation, underscoring the importance of managers balancing high commitment from CSR and high performance from automation.","Automation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Paradox Theory; Sustainability; Behavioral Research; Economic And Social Effects; Environmental Management; Finance; Metadata; Social Aspects; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Environmental Performance; Financial Performance; Joint Effect; Operational Efficiencies; Organisational; Paradox Theory; Performance; Social Performance; Automation; Sustainable Development","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Finance; Metadata; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibility; Digital transformation; Environmental performance; Financial performance; Joint effect; Operational efficiencies; Organisational; Paradox theory; Performance; Social performance; Automation; Sustainable development","Funding text 1: This project was financially supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for financial support in project n\u25E6 40355720232 .

For instance, Industry 4.0/5.0 research has shown that automation technologies, such as robotics and sensors, can support CSR goals by reducing workplace accidents, minimizing waste, and enabling cleaner production systems (Aniceski et al., 2024; Machado et al., 2020). From this perspective, automation is not inherently an opposing element to CSR but can enhance environmental performance and worker safety, aligning with sustainability and social responsibility objectives. Moreover, studies from Dornelles et al. (2023) and Frank et al. (2024) suggested that automation integrated with smart technologies facilitates transparency, ethical sourcing, and stakeholder engagement, creating synergies in social values and performance strategies rather than tensions. These views emphasize integration and alignment between technological and social practices, reflecting convergence rather than a contradiction between CSR and automation.According to the International Standard of ISO 26000 (International Organization for Standardization, 2010), CSR aims to promote sustainability. In addition, CSR promotes competitive advantage by attracting and retaining different stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and shareholders (Anser et al., 2018). Measuring CSR with the stakeholder perspective is important in OM since it considers value creation for employees, suppliers, and customers and how to reach sustainability in companies (Burke and Logsdon, 1996; Cornelius et al., 2008). However, a significant academic debate has been on whether CSR contributes to financial performance, showing conflicting evidence of this relationship (Coelho et al., 2023). Accordingly, the theme remains inconclusive in its causal effect (Wang et al., 2016). Some research streams support a positive correlation between CSR and financial performance (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Such scholars posit that CSR adoption benefits a firm's revenues since organizations value their customers. In addition, CSR also contributes to the return on investment (ROI) when respecting and being transparent with suppliers and customers in supply chain operations (A\u011Fan et al., 2016). Therefore, we propose hypothesis H1a, in which we test the direct positive effect of CSR on financial performance.Lastly, CSR is important in technology implementation, especially when considering the DT phenomena, since it involves cultural factors and organizational mindset changes (Xu et al., 2023; Zhong and Ren, 2023). CSR implementation in the supply chain may support transparency and trust, leveraging the digitalization of processes and data sharing among stakeholders (Tong et al., 2018). Furthermore, employee CSR efforts may promote an interface for adequate technological acceptance, considering employees' roles and participation in DT implementation (Nie et al., 2024).The interplay between CSR and automation often creates a paradox as organizations strive to balance the seemingly conflicting objectives of social responsibility and technological advancement. For example, companies like Amazon always look at logistics and warehousing automation solutions to increase efficiency. However, despite automation solutions enabling faster delivery outcomes, they raised serious concerns about worker exploitation, job displacement, and injuries in recent years for Amazon (Vallas et al., 2022). On the one hand, CSR initiatives\u2014such as investments in sustainability, labor equity, and community engagement\u2014are designed to create value for various stakeholders. However, these initiatives typically require significant investments that can constrain short-term financial returns (Jarzabkowski and Sillince, 2007). For instance, China's manufacturing sector significantly increased in firms disclosing CSR reports to demonstrate their commitment to environmental and social responsibilities. The pressure to showcase strong CSR performance led some companies to allocate resources toward environmental protection investments and pollution charges. While these actions improved CSR scores, they diverted funds from green innovation and automation projects, potentially hindering long-term technological advancements in the industry (Hao and He, 2022). On the other hand, automation, which focuses on streamlining processes, reducing costs, and increasing productivity, can lead to improved financial performance (Dornelles et al., 2023). The tension between CSR and automation arises when organizations seek to pursue both societal benefits and financial returns simultaneously, particularly when automation results in workforce displacement or exacerbates social inequalities.This project was financially supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for financial support in project n\u25E6 40355720232.

The growing prevalence of consumer activism represents a fundamental shift in consumer-corporate relationships, where ethical considerations increasingly drive purchasing decisions. Despite extensive research on boycott outcomes, significant gaps exist in understanding the longitudinal effects of boycotts across diverse cultural contexts and the specific mechanisms through which social media amplifies these movements. This study addresses these gaps by examining: (1) the psychological and sociocultural factors driving consumer participation in boycotts; (2) the impact of corporate responses on brand reputation and financial performance; and (3) the role of social media in facilitating consumer activism. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed articles from the Scopus database published between 2019-2024, initially identifying 8,958 documents which were screened down to 45 final articles based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The methodology combines quantitative bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software and qualitative synthesis. Our findings reveal that consumer boycotts significantly impact both immediate sales and long-term brand reputation, particularly when boycotts are perceived as credible and widely supported. The research demonstrates that boycott participation is driven by complex motivational factors including ethnocentrism, religious beliefs, and social identity, which vary significantly across demographic and cultural contexts. Companies that fail to address consumer concerns face substantial financial losses, while those engaging in proactive corporate social responsibility can mitigate negative impacts. This research contributes a comprehensive framework for understanding consumer boycotts and their strategic implications, highlighting the necessity for businesses to integrate ethical considerations and align communications with consumer values. It extends existing literature by identifying the need for longitudinal and cross-cultural studies to better understand consumer activism in today's conscientious marketplace.","Consumer Activism; Corporate Accountability; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Activism; Ethical Consumption; Value-based Consumption","","","Afego, Pyemo N., What does corporate social advocacy signal?

This article, based on data from Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2022, uses a panel data model to analyze the impact of corporate digital transformation on carbon emission intensity and its mechanisms. The research findings reveal that: firstly, corporate digital transformation significantly reduces carbon emission intensity; this conclusion remains valid after robustness checks. Secondly, mechanism analysis indicates that corporate digital transformation further reduces carbon emission intensity by enhancing corporate social responsibility and total factor productivity levels. Thirdly, the impact of corporate digital transformation on carbon emission intensity shows heterogeneity between heavily polluting industries and non-heavily polluting industries, as well as between low-carbon pilot cities and non-low-carbon pilot cities, with the carbon reduction effect of corporate digital transformation being more pronounced in non-heavily polluting industries and low-carbon pilot cities. The conclusions of this study can provide empirical evidence for China to achieve its goals of “carbon neutrality” and ""carbon peak"", and also hold certain implications for other developing countries.","Carbon Emission Intensity; Digital Transformation; Social Responsibility; Total Factor Productivity","","","Bai, Tingting, Digital economy, industrial transformation and upgrading, and spatial transfer of carbon emissions: The paths for low-carbon transformation of Chinese cities, Journal of Environmental Management, 344, (2023); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

The data collected were analyzed using IBM SPSS and AMOS statistical software. The results indicate that aspects of DCSR, including digital ethical and legal responsibility, digital social responsibility, and digital philanthropy, influence brand awareness and image. Effective use of digital platforms enables brands to communicate their social responsibility initiatives to a wider audience, potentially increasing brand awareness and image by positively influencing consumer perception. Thus, brands' engagement in corporate social responsibility initiatives in the digital realm, along with their alignment to similar communication strategies, can influence their brand awareness and image.","Brand; Brand Awareness; Brand Image; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Corporate Social Responsibility","","","Al Omoush, Khaled Saleh, The impact of digital corporate social responsibility on social entrepreneurship and organizational resilience, Management Decision, 62, 8, pp. 2621-2640, (2024); Ansary, Amin, Brand image and equity: the mediating role of brand equity drivers and moderating effects of product type and word of mouth, Review of Managerial Science, 12, 4, pp. 969-1002, (2018); Araújo, Joana, The Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility on Brand Image and Brand Equity and Its Impact on Consumer Satisfaction, Administrative Sciences, 13, 5, (2023); International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2024); Bhattacharya, C.

In the qualitative phase, three key dimensions—ethical, legal, and sustainability-oriented responsibilities—along with 11 indicators were identified through a combination of a literature review and Delphi interviews. In the quantitative phase, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on survey data from organizational representatives, confirming the robustness of the proposed measurement model. The findings confirm the proposed measurement model for Corporate Digital Responsibility and demonstrate that Corporate Digital Responsibility practices significantly enhance digital sustainability by promoting transparency, accountability, and environmental responsibility.

The main finding remains significant when we employ 2SLS and PSM-DiD approaches to address potential endogeneity concerns. The mechanism tests reveal that the main finding is driven by the reduction of financial constraints facilitated by D&O insurance, although this positive effect can be weakened by the overinvestment restrictions associated with D&O insurance.

Taking Chinese manufacturing companies as the research sample, empirical analyses including fixed effect model, propensity score matching, and staggered Differences-in-Differences methods have demonstrated that digital strategy can boost manufacturing companies' TFP. Further, stepwise regression analysis of the mechanisms revealed that while the transformation primarily boosts productivity directly, it also indirectly boosts TFP by reinforcing employee and public responsibilities.

This study delves into the complex connection between CED and corporate attributes. The study aims to uncover carbon emission (CE) transparency within the organization and provide environmental sustainability. The data were collected from 420 professionals from diverse industry sectors (IS). Board diversity (BD) and IS influence carbon disclosure (CD) behaviors, and elucidate the symbiotic relationship between financial performance (FP) and sustainability commitments. The SPSS program was used to examine the gathered data. The results show that firms with strong FP and governance structures (GS) have been positively correlated with transparent CED. The study result indicates companies engage in more transparent CED to maintain stakeholder trust and attract socially responsible investors. The study’s novelty lies in promoting transparency, and accountability on CED in the corporate governance (CG) and principles, as well as transformative corporate environment sustainability practices in a dynamic business landscape. The study contributed to providing valuable insights to companies exhibiting higher levels of CED and operating the firms with an environmental conscience. This research further contributes to offering actionable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and investors seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of corporate sustainability. GSs are fostered to drive positive environmental outcomes and promote ecological performances and the trust of the stakeholders.

This work helps fill a gap in the literature by studying how companies in the Chinese auto industry benefit from their reputations when it comes to brand valuation. Previous studies on CSR and consumer behavior largely ignore brand valuation as an important outcome and do not link their findings to a main theory. The study introduces Social Exchange Theory, Stakeholder Theory, and the Corporate Social Performance Model to the literature to design a well-structured framework. The analysis was based on 300 surveys of Chinese consumers from several automobile brands using SEM via AMOS to test the hypotheses. The research established that DCSR considerably raises a brand's valuation, which results from strong customer satisfaction and is affected by customer engagement as a moderating factor. It appears that combining digital CSR with a customer-focused approach in business strategy attracts customers and in the long run, benefits the brand. This study introduces useful information that helps plan and implement CSR strategies in the digital sphere. By offering a novel perspective on the synergistic relationship between digital CSR, customer satisfaction, and brand valuation within the competitive and dynamic realm of China's automobile sector, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the strategic integration of CSR into business practices. It not only enriches the academic discussion on this subject but also provides actionable insights for practitioners aiming to leverage the power of CSR in the digital age, setting a precedent for future research and implementation in the domain.","Automobile Industry Of China; Brand Valuation; Customer Engagement; Customer Satisfaction; Digital Corporate Social Responsibility","","We acknowledge that this research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 72362008, 71962007), Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation High-level Talents Project: 722RC627, the 111 Project (Grant Number: D21023).","Acemoglu, Daron, Automation and new tasks: How technology displaces and reinstates labor, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33, 2, pp. 3-30, (2019); Afzali, Hajir, Consumers’ responses to corporate social responsibility: The mediating role of csr authenticity, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-13, (2021); Aghaei, Mohammad Ali, Valuation of the Hamrah-e-Aval brand based on brand valuation models using Topsis multi-criteria decision-making model, Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management, 20, 1, pp. 42-53, (2021); Ahamed, M.

Drawing on a large sample of 14,036 firm-year observations from U.S.-listed firms between 2005 and 2018, we find that heightened exposure to cybersecurity risk is significantly associated with improved ESG performance, particularly in the environmental dimension. Our results further indicate that this positive association is amplified in firms where the CEO also serves as the board chair, suggesting that centralized leadership structures enhance strategic agility and resource allocation in response to emerging risks. We address potential endogeneity concerns using robust econometric techniques, including two-stage least squares (2SLS) and Heckman selection models, confirming the reliability of our findings. These insights extend current ESG frameworks by incorporating digital resilience as an emerging driver of sustainability performance and enrich governance theory by highlighting the contextual influence of CEO duality on risk management strategies. The study offers practical implications for corporate leaders, investors, and policymakers. Firms can leverage cybersecurity risk management as a catalyst for strengthening ESG practices, particularly in sectors exposed to high digital risks. Governance structures that enable swift decision-making may enhance firms’ capacity to align cybersecurity and sustainability goals. Policymakers are encouraged to consider integrating cybersecurity metrics into ESG disclosure frameworks to promote more comprehensive corporate accountability and resilience in the digital era.","Ceo Duality; Cybersecurity Risk; Esg; Usa; Cybersecurity; Investments; Risk Management; Sustainable Development; Ceo Duality; Corporates; Cyber Security; Cyber Threats; Cybersecurity Risk; Environmental, Social, And Governance; Performance; Policy Makers; Strategic Response; Usa; Decision Making; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Governance Approach; Industrial Performance; Leadership; Policy Making; Resource Allocation; Article; Computer Security; Corporate Social Responsibility; Correlation Coefficient; Cyberattack; Defense Mechanism; Digital Transformation; Donkey; Environmental Management; Funding; Independent Variable; Multivariate Analysis; Performance; Reliability; Risk Management; Stakeholder Engagement; Threat; Human; United States; Computer Security; Humans; Leadership; Risk Management","Cybersecurity; Investments; Risk management; Sustainable development; CEO duality; Corporates; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cybersecurity risk; Environmental, social, and governance; Performance; Policy makers; Strategic response; USA; Decision making; corporate strategy; decision making; governance approach; industrial performance; leadership; policy making; resource allocation; Article; computer security; corporate social responsibility; correlation coefficient; cyberattack; defense mechanism; digital transformation; donkey; environmental management; funding; independent variable; multivariate analysis; performance; reliability; risk management; stakeholder engagement; threat; human; United States; Computer Security; Humans; Leadership; Risk Management","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University , Saudi Arabia, under Project Grant KFU252188.","Aabo, Tom, Do female CEOs matter for ESG scores?, Global Finance Journal, 56, (2023); Abdullah, undefined, CEO power, board features and ESG performance: An extensive novel moderation analysis, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 31, 6, pp. 5627-5655, (2024); Ali, Shahid, “How” and “When” CEO Duality Matter?

Thus, this study aims to examine the negative effects of CDiR as a brand's psychological contract violation and CDR communication as a recovery strategy on consumers’ brand perceptions. By conducting a mixed-design experiment, this study found that CDiR negatively affects consumers’ brand attitude, thereby leading to an increased switch intention. Furthermore, the findings indicated that abstract messages about CDR practices can adversely affect consumers’ brand perceptions, while specific messages can alleviate the negative impacts of CDiR, as they increase credibility and reduce image wash.","Communication Specificity; Consumer-brand Relationship; Corporate Digital Irresponsibility (cdir); Corporate Digital Responsibility (cdr)","","","Abu Zayyad, Hala Mohammed, Corporate social responsibility and patronage intentions: The mediating effect of brand credibility, Journal of Marketing Communications, 27, 5, pp. 510-533, (2021); Ahmad, Naveed, From screen to service: how corporate social responsibility messages on social media shape hotel consumer advocacy, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 33, 3, pp. 384-413, (2024); Ahn, Jiseon, The structural effects of affective and cognitive elaboration in formation of customer–brand relationship, Service Industries Journal, 40, 3-4, pp. 226-242, (2020); International Journal of Humanities and Social Science, (2012); Alnawas, Ibrahim A.M., The effect of service failure severity on brand forgiveness: the moderating role of interpersonal attachment styles and thinking styles, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 35, 5, pp. 1691-1712, (2023); International Journal of Management Accounting and Economics, (2015); Atkinson, Lucy Jane, Signaling the green sell: The influence of eco-label source, argument specificity, and product involvement on consumer trust, Journal of Advertising, 43, 1, pp. 33-45, (2014); Bartikowski, Boris P., Attribute framing in CSR communication: Doing good and spreading the word – But how?, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 700-708, (2021); Management Competing in the New Era, (2002); Becker-Olsen, Karen L., The impact of perceived corporate social responsibility on consumer behavior, Journal of Business Research, 59, 1, pp. 46-53, (2006)","","Elsevier Ltd","02784319","","IJHMD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000608345"

Our findings indicate that CD exacerbates CGW, as it exacerbates information asymmetry between companies and stakeholders through impression management, information manipulation and increasing the complexity of corporate operations, all of which can lead to CGW.

The aim is to detect the attributes linked to social innovation and CSR and verify whether they are consistent with those found in the scientific literature. The results show that social innovation and CSR are linked to the terms “company,” “novelty,” and “institution,” as well as “pandemic” due to the study timeframe (2017–2022). Separate co-occurrence analyses of the terms “social,” “communication,” “innovation,” “policies,” “strategies,” and “practices” show that “company,” “development,” and “institutions” are relevant terms in all cases. The analyses reveal their prevalence in the generalist press. The presence of these terms is discussed in reference to the theoretical framework provided by the scientific literature. This semantic analysis empirically shows that the generalist press portrays social innovation and CSR in a way that is coherent with the portrayal in the academic literature.

The findings reveal a rapid increase in research on digital transformation and sustainability since 2017, with key themes including Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and circular economy. However, the analysis also highlights notable conceptual fragmentation, emphasizing the need for a more integrated theoretical framework, especially in fields such as performance measurement and corporate social responsibility.

This study focuses on the perspective of executives’ financial backgrounds and, based on the upper echelon theory, empirically analyzes the impact and mechanisms of executives’ financial background on corporate ESG performance using data from A-share listed companies in China from 2008 to 2022. From the perspectives of resource acquisition and risk-taking, the results show that executives’ financial background can effectively enhance corporate ESG performance, and this holds true even after distinguishing the three dimensions of environment, responsibility, and governance. Mechanism analysis indicates that executives’ financial background can effectively alleviate corporate financing constraints and increase risk-taking levels, thereby enhancing corporate ESG performance. Further analysis reveals that both male and female CEOs have a positive effect, with female CEOs having a stronger impact. Moreover, local CEOs exhibit a more significant positive effect compared to non-local CEOs. In addition, digital finance plays a positive moderating role between executives’ financial background and ESG performance, and this positive moderating effect holds across all three sub-dimensions of ESG. This paper enriches relevant research on upper echelon theory and financing theory, offering both theoretical and practical insights into corporate executives’ strategic choices and ESG performance. It also provides valuable implications for governments in adjusting digital finance development strategies and corporate resource governance.","Digital Finance; Esg Performance; Executives’ Financial Background; Female Ceo; Financing Constraints; Risk-taking; Corporate Social Responsibility; Finance; Industrial Performance; Risk; Womens Employment; China","corporate social responsibility; finance; industrial performance; risk; womens employment; China","This research is supported by following programs: National Social Science Fund project (Grant ID: 22GBL069);Guangzhou University Graduate Innovation Ability Training Funding Program (Grant ID: 2022GDJC-D05).","Amin, Ali H., CEO personal characteristics and firms’ risk-taking behaviour: the moderating role of family ownership, Gender in Management, 39, 2, pp. 165-187, (2024); Ajdacic, Lena, Status hierarchies and norm diffusion: the increase of top incomes in high finance, Socio-Economic Review, 20, 4, pp. 1767-1794, (2022); Bax, Karoline, Do lower environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rated companies have higher systemic impact?

The empirical results demonstrate that actively fulfilling social responsibility can enhance a company's energy utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the development of the digital economy contributes to improving energy utilization efficiency. The digital economy plays a moderating role in the relationship between CSR fulfillment and corporate energy utilization efficiency, with this moderating effect exhibiting heterogeneity between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private enterprises (PEs). Moreover, the impact of CSR and the digital economy on energy utilization efficiency show heterogeneity between SOEs and PEs.","Digital Economy; Energy Utilization Efficiency; Social Responsibility","","Funding text 1: To investigate the influence of CSR on the enterprises\u2019 energy utilization efficiency and explore potential differences between SOEs and PEs, this study segments the entire sample into SOE and PE samples and performs separate regression analyses. In Table 6, the coefficients for CSR are 2.8179 and 0.5040 for SOE and PE samples, respectively, which are both significant. A comparison of the magnitudes of the CSR coefficients across different enterprise samples indicates that CSR has a more significant impact on the energy utilization efficiency of SOEs, thus confirming H5. SOEs, which have mandated policy-driven environmental goals, must enhance their energy efficiency through technological innovation to meet regulatory pressures. Their CSR-disclosure mechanisms are directly linked to performance evaluations, and they possess stronger resource allocation capabilities. However, PEs are more susceptible to market fluctuations and often prioritize short-term profit-oriented CSR investments while lacking policy-driven systematic energy-saving support. These structural differences create disparities in their motivations for energy efficiency improvements.; Funding text 2: Shui-mu Tsinghua Scholar Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71772113).","Cao, Xinghua, The impact of public participation in environmental governance on the technical efficiency of enterprise, Finance Research Letters, 62, (2024); Cardinali, Pier Giacomo, Responsible digitalization through digital technologies and green practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 4, pp. 984-995, (2022); Chen, Pengyu, Digital transformation and corporate environmental performance: The moderating role of board characteristics, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1757-1767, (2022); Chen, Shengqi, Does digital finance promote manufacturing servitization: Micro evidence from China, International Review of Economics and Finance, 76, pp. 856-869, (2021); Dabbous, Amal, Does sharing economy promote sustainable economic development and energy efficiency?

These challenges relate broadly to the nature of technological advancements in the use of digital technologies and their associated ethical implications. Objective: To analyse the ethical dilemmas organisations come across in the current environment and offer appropriate recommendations on handling these concerns, especially ethical management, stakeholder management and acknowledgement. Methodology: The study employed a descriptive survey design, utilising a structured questionnaire as the primary data collection instrument. The quantitative analysis methods used in this study encompassed descriptive statistical analysis, inferential statistical analysis, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis to establish patterns of relationships. Results: The leading ethical issues for participants were: personal data protection (mean score = 4.2), ethical usage of AI algorithms (mean score = 3.9), job displacement due to AI technology (mean score = 3.1), and the digital divide. Statistical analysis demonstrated positive and significant associations: Data privacy and ethical prioritisation (t-value = 45, p < 0.001), Algorithmic ethics and ethical prioritisation (B = 0.35, p = 0.004), Factor analysis identified three critical variables: data privacy and security, ethical algorithms and workforce displacement accounted for 75% of the variance on average. Hypothesis testing revealed significant differences by industry in the ethical standards evidenced (F(2, 265) = 5.23, p = 0.002, η² = 0.14). Conclusion: Although organisations understand that ethics is a critical component of their operations, they often face numerous and significant barriers to ethics. Unique Contribution: This research makes a significant contribution to the literature by highlighting the major ethical issues contemporary organisations face and by offering balanced, specific advice on how organisations can address these issues within the context of digitalisation. Key Recommendation: Organisations should adopt ethical leadership, actively engage stakeholders, and enhance organisational transparency to resolve ethical challenges, while also contributing to sustainable development in a digital landscape.","Algorithmic Ethics; Corporate Responsibility; Data Ethics; Data Privacy; Ethical Leadership","","","Alhawamdeh, Hamzeh, The relationship between marketing capabilities and financial performance: the moderating role of customer relationship management in Jordanian SMES, Cogent Business and Management, 11, 1, (2024); Journal of Asian Finance Economics and Business, (2022); Alshaketheep, Khaled M.K.Ismail, Innovative digital marketing for promoting SDG 2030 knowledge in Jordanian universities in the Middle East, Discover Sustainability, 5, 1, (2024); Chen, Pengyu, The impact of digital transformation on innovation performance - The mediating role of innovation factors, Heliyon, 9, 3, (2023); Durán, Juan Manuel, Who is afraid of black box algorithms?

Moreover, green credit and digital transformation are inevitable, but coordination is needed between banks, the government, and related organizations to implement them successfully. Objective: This study examines the relationship between green credit, digitalization, and bank stability in Vietnam. Methodology: The authors employed moments quantile regression (MMQR) to elucidate varied effects across varying levels of bank stability. The research used a panel dataset of Vietnamese commercial banks from 2010 to 2022. Data were obtained from the annual reports of the State Bank and banks. Result: The results showed that each corporate social responsibility (CSR) component has different dimensions, such as shareholders, employees, customers, government, social, community, and environmental responsibility, which have different impacts on bank stability. Digital transformation is an essential solution to achieve sustainable development goals and opens up opportunities to help banks improve their competitiveness in the market. Conclusion: There is a nonlinear relationship where higher levels of CSR engagement are associated with lower bank stability, but this negative effect diminishes at higher levels of CSR. In addition to using digital tools, green credit is essential in successfully implementing green programs to ensure banking sustainability. Unique Contribution: The study has shown that CSR's positive impact on stability is more substantial for state-owned commercial banks and that the benefits of CSR may diminish during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key Recommendation: Investments in digitalisation initially reduce bank stability due to high technology costs, but the interaction of digitalisation with CSR optimises efficiency and reduces information asymmetry, promoting long-term stability.","And Mmqr; Bank Stability; Csr; Digitalization; Green Credit","","The author acknowledges support from the University of Finance \u2013 Marketing, Vietnam.","Adikaram, Ruwan K.B., Exploring the role of analysts in identifying and communicating the value of bank CSR activity, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 42, 4, pp. 698-721, (2024); Diponegoro International Journal of Business, (2023); Chen, Hungyu, Behavioral Intentions of Bank Employees to Implement Green Finance, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 15, (2023); Information Management and Business Review, (2023); Galán, Jorge E., Green light for green credit?

The results of the study reveal that DFI can empower SMEs' high-quality development. Internally, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and green technological innovation play positive intermediary roles in the process of DFI to enable SMEs' high-quality development. Externally, the efficiency of financial resource allocation (EFR) and upgrading of the industrial structure (IS) mediate the process. However, these internal and external mechanisms exhibit heterogeneity across different industries and regions. Therefore, strengthening the empowering role of DFI to promote high-quality development of SMEs, encouraging SMEs to actively fulfill their social responsibilities, increasing investment in green technological innovation, enhancing the EFR, and facilitating IS upgrading remain vital.

Hence, this study empirically discusses the intrinsic mechanisms of digitalization on industrial enterprises’ green transformation by employing a two-way fixed effects model from the perspectives of financing constraints and corporate social responsibility using Chinese A-share listed industrial enterprises from 2011 to 2020. The results illustrate that digitalization is essential in facilitating industrial enterprises’ green transformation. This impact is significant in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and manufacturing enterprises, whereas non-SOEs, mining, and energy-producing industries play a limited role. Manifestly, digitalization can leverage industrial enterprises’ green transformation by inhibiting financing constraints and increasing corporate social responsibility. These findings provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for comprehending the mechanism of digitalization and green transformation of industrial enterprises.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitalization; Financing Constraints; Green Transformation; Green Development; Green Economy; C12; C30; Corporate Social Responsibility; D21; Digitalization; Digitisation; Financing Constraints; Green Transformation; Industrial Enterprise; State Owned Enterprise; Decentralized Finance","Green development; Green economy; C12; C30; Corporate social responsibility; D21; Digitalization; Digitisation; Financing constraints; Green transformation; Industrial enterprise; State owned enterprise; Decentralized finance","","Benassi, Mario, State-owned enterprises as knowledge-explorer agents, Industry and Innovation, 26, 2, pp. 218-241, (2019); Ren, Yaofa, Residents' concerns and attitudes toward a municipal solid waste landfill: Integrating a questionnaire survey and GIS techniques, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 185, 12, pp. 10001-10013, (2013); Chen, Qingping, Financing Constraints and Environmental Performance: Management in Resource Constraint Settings, Mobile Information Systems, 2022, (2022); Cheng, Jun, The effects of public attention on the environmental performance of high-polluting firms: Based on big data from web search in China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 186, pp. 335-341, (2018); Manag World, (2021); Fernando, Yudi, The blockchain-enabled technology and carbon performance: Insights from early adopters, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); Fieseler, Christian, Corporate social responsibility in the blogosphere, Journal of Business Ethics, 91, 4, pp. 599-614, (2010); Eur Res Stud J, (2021); Govindan, Kannan, Theory Building Through Corporate Social Responsibility 4.0 for Achieving SDGs: A Practical Step Toward Integration of Digitalization with Practice-Based View and Social Good Theory, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 71, pp. 2103-2120, (2024); Hadlock, Charles J., New evidence on measuring financial constraints: Moving beyond the KZ index, Review of Financial Studies, 23, 5, pp. 1909-1940, (2010)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","1618954X; 16189558","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206991873"

The research utilizes data from 1028 manufacturing firms in China and specifically explores the impact of CSR fulfillment on BMI within the digital innovation ecosystem. The findings indicate that both internal CSR (ICSR) and external CSR (ECSR) have a significant positive influence on BMI, with ECSR having a stronger effect. Additionally, the study reveals that value co-creation (VCC) plays a mediating role in strengthening the relationship between CSR fulfillment and BMI. Furthermore, the study highlights that the positive association between CSR fulfillment and BMI is more prominent in firms with higher digital platform capability (DPC).

The article is based on an inter-, multi-, even transdisciplinary and critical reading of the transformations brought by AI in the sphere of corporate responsibility, starting from the premises of a governance that integrates moral lucidity and normative rigour. Instead of fragmented or purely reactive regulation, a shared collective responsibility is taking shape. Algorithmic technologies, while appearing to be neutral instruments, must be treated as expressions of institutional wills that effectively shape social reality. In this system, due diligence becomes a practice of continual vigilance, and legal liability extends to hitherto ignored areas, such as system design, data selection and the impact on individual autonomy. A vision in which corporations actively contribute to upholding human dignity, ecological balance and democratic pluralism by assuming a moral contract that precedes and underpins positive regulation is brought to the fore. The approach is academic and critical, linking legal doctrine, regulatory analysis, relevant case law and technological impact. The conclusions emphasise the emergence of a new legal-ethical system in which companies developing or using AI are legally and morally bound to prevent and remedy adverse effects on human rights.","Anticipatory Liability; Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Accountability; Digital Governance; Due Diligence; Global Justice; Human Rights; Legal-ethical Contracts; The United Nations Treaty On Business And Human Rights","","","Almada, Marco, THE EU AI ACT: BETWEEN THE ROCK OF PRODUCT SAFETY AND THE HARD PLACE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, Common Market Law Review, 62, 1, pp. 85-120, (2025); Human Rights Watch; Cooley; undefined; Delfi as V Estonia no 64 569 09 European Court of Human Rights Grand Chamber, (2015); Official Journal of the European Union L 2853; Duffourc, Mindy Nunez, The proposed EU Directives for AI liability leave worrying gaps likely to impact medical AI, npj Digital Medicine, 6, 1, (2023); undefined; Eva Glawischnig Piesczek V Facebook Ireland Limited C 18 18 Court of Justice of the European Union, (2019); Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Implementing the United Nations Protect Respect and Remedy Framework, (2011)","","Society of Juridical and Administrative Sciences","3008637X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011495158"

The research uses Carroll's (1991) CSR Pyramid, together with Porter & Kramer's (2011) Creating Shared Value theory, to study the impact of CSR programs on consumer perceptions and actions. The research used quantitative survey data combined with qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with CSR managers who work in retail and technology sectors and sustainable goods industries to gather information. The research evidence reveals that measurements of consumer loyalty are positively correlated with CSR perception evaluations. The implementation of sustainability and transparency-focused CSR programs has brought profitable economic results, including market and revenue expansion. The digital age helps businesses improve the visibility of their CSR activities, gaining greater consumer trust and engagement as their audience grows older. Business competition in the present era relies heavily on CSR as a strategic element that creates enduring customer relationships and expands sustainable business operations. The research also investigates the emergence of greenwashing risks by studying authentic CSR communication practices.

This study aims to examine the influence of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on green investment behavior in manufacturing enterprises, with a focus on the mediating role of information acceptance. The research responds to the growing need for sustainable business strategies and the increasing importance of digital communication in shaping corporate decision-making. Design/Methodology: The study integrates three theoretical frameworks: Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), Information Adoption Model (IAM), and Information Acceptance Model (IACM) to develop a comprehensive research model. Data were collected from 350 manufacturing firms in Vietnam through structured questionnaires. Structural equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships among variables. Findings: The results reveal that several eWOM components - such as information quality, credibility, need and attitude toward information-significantly affect GI behavior. Moreover, information acceptance mediates the relationship between eWOM and GI. However, information quantity was found to have no significant direct or indirect effect on GI. Implications and Recommendations: The findings suggest that managers should focus on improving the quality and reliability of digital information sources and foster a culture of proactive information engagement. Policymakers should enhance support for digital infrastructure and communication strategies to promote green transition in manufacturing. Originality/Value: This study is among the first to apply an integrated theoretical model (ELM-IAM-IACM) to examine how eWOM affects GI in the business context. It contributes both theoretically and practically by clarifying the information-processing mechanisms behind strategic investment decisions in the digital and sustainability era.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Green Business; Green Growth; Green Information Management; Sustaianable Business; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Economics; Green Economy; Information Management; Internet; Investment; Sustainable Development; Technology Adoption; Viet Nam","corporate social responsibility; environmental economics; green economy; information management; Internet; investment; sustainable development; technology adoption; Viet Nam","This study is funded by the National Economics University, Vietnam.","Journal of Sustainable Business, (2015); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alnaim, Abdullah F., Enhancing Green Electronic Word-of-Mouth in the Saudi Tourism Industry: An Integration of the Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity and Planned Behaviour Theories, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 11, (2023); Journal of Economics and Development, (2020); International Journal of Csr, (2016); Cai, Songbo, Leveraging Customer Green Behavior Toward Green Marketing Mix and Electronic Word-of-Mouth, Sustainability (Switzerland), 17, 6, (2025); Business Strategy and the Environment, (2020); J Clean Prod, (2015); Journal of Sustainable Business, (2016); Decis Support Syst, (2009)","","Institute of Physics","25157620","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009387472"

Brands that chose self-disclosure were seen as more socially responsible and transparent, which in turn raised trust and lifted purchase intent. These gains were strongest for users who care deeply about the category or the brand and remained robust even among highly health-conscious shoppers.

This is because the law does not regulate what is good and even lawful activities may lead to harms. At the same time, data ethics requires clear guidelines that can be adopted by organizations. To address this, the authors propose situating data protection within the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) paradigms. This incentivizes the adoption of ethical practices thanks to the potential for organizations to improve their ESG ratings. To this end, the Maastricht University Data Protection as a Corporate Social Responsibility Framework is provided as a solution. The Framework provides actionable and auditable controls with the ultimate aim of promoting responsible data practices that benefit not only businesses, but also individuals and society. Novelty and contribution to knowledge: This paper builds upon the work illustrated in Data Protection as a Corporate Social Responsibility (Edward Elgar, 2023) to provide an overview of the need for taking an ethical approach to data protection and cybersecurity compliance.

This paper examines the impact of a collaborative air pollution control model involving the government, enterprises, and the public in reducing pollution emissions. Utilizing panel data encompassing 274 cities in China from 2009 to 2022, the study employs the panel fixed-effect model to assess the efficacy of pairwise synergies among the government, enterprises, and the public. The study also investigates how digital technology enhances information transparency and fosters technological innovation, thereby strengthening these synergies and significantly improving the overall efficiency of air pollution control. The results indicate that pairwise synergies among the government, enterprises, and the public significantly reduce pollutant emissions. However, the impact of 'tripartite coordination' on air pollution control is not statistically significant. Digital technology effectively strengthens the “pairwise synergies” mechanism and significantly improves the overall efficiency of air pollution control. This study enriches the air pollution control theory, provides a new perspective for understanding the complex mechanism of multi-subject collaborative environmental governance, and provides important implications for policymakers.","Collaborative Environmental Governance; Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Digital Empowerment; Government Environmental Regulation; Public Environmental Concern; Collaborative Environmental Governance; Corporate Environmental Responsibilities; Digital Empowerment; Digital Technologies; Environmental Concerns; Environmental Governances; Environmental Pollutions; Government Environmental Regulation; Overall Efficiency; Public Environmental Concern","Collaborative environmental governance; Corporate environmental responsibilities; Digital empowerment; Digital technologies; Environmental concerns; Environmental governances; Environmental pollutions; Government environmental regulation; Overall efficiency; Public environmental concern","This work was supported by the following foundations: National Natural Science Foundation (grant number: 72304250); Zhejiang Provincial Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Project (grant number: 24NDQN093YB).","Arantes, Virginie, Coping with waste: A government-NGO collaborative governance approach in Shanghai, Journal of Environmental Management, 259, (2020); Ay, Nihat, Information flows in causal networks, Advances in Complex Systems, 11, 1, pp. 17-41, (2008); Bodin, Örjan, Collaborative environmental governance: Achieving collective action in social-ecological systems, Science, 357, 6352, (2017); A Vacuum of Responsibility Ngo Perceptions and Response to Environmental Issues in Russia, (2011); Diao, Minghui, Methods, availability, and applications of PM2.5 exposure estimates derived from ground measurements, satellite, and atmospheric models, Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 69, 12, pp. 1391-1414, (2019); ElHaffar, Ghina, Towards closing the attitude-intention-behavior gap in green consumption: A narrative review of the literature and an overview of future research directions, Journal of Cleaner Production, 275, (2020); Eweje, Gabriel, Multi-stakeholder partnerships: a catalyst to achieve sustainable development goals, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 39, 2, pp. 186-212, (2021); Feng, Suling, Digital financial development and ecological footprint: Evidence from green-biased technology innovation and environmental inclusion, Journal of Cleaner Production, 380, (2022); Feng, Yueyi, Defending blue sky in China: Effectiveness of the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan” on air quality improvements from 2013 to 2017, Journal of Environmental Management, 252, (2019); Guo, Jin, The role of public participation in environmental governance: Empirical evidence from China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 17, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002885940"

It argues that the law remains disproportionately focused on individual rights and duties, even though group dynamics demonstrably shape behaviour. The paper therefore calls for the formal recognition of informal groups and the integration of collective responsibility to reflect current social realities more accurately. Methodology: Employing a historical-legal and interdisciplinary lens, the study traces the evolution of individualism from Roman law to modern legal frameworks. It combines comparative legal analysis, theoretical critique, and normative analysis to propose legal reforms that reconcile individual autonomy with collective accountability. Findings: Historically, legal systems have privileged individualism and underestimated the influence of groups. As a result, informal collectives often lack protection and meaningful participation in legal processes. This over-emphasis on the individual hampers effective responses to systemic discrimination, environmental harm, and labour rights violations. Although certain branches—such as corporate and environmental law—implicitly recognise collective responsibility, explicit mechanisms to balance individual and group interests are still required. Flexible legal models can integrate group accountability without eroding personal rights. Practical implications: Conferring limited legal personality on informal groups would enable them to assert rights without full formalisation. A calibrated balance between individual and collective liability would enhance the law’s capacity to address problems that demand shared responsibility. Strengthening collective legal tools—such as class actions, trade unions, and community governance—would improve legal representation, while the use of AI-enabled digital platforms could foster participatory law-making and deliver fairer legal structures.","Collective Responsibility; Group Dynamics; Individualism; Informal Groups","","","Crisis of the Republic, (1972); Origins of Totalitarianism, (1951); Politics; Social Psychology, (1952); Two Cities, (1992); Utrecht Pedestrian Zone Netherlands, (2010); Digital Media and Democratic Futures, (2019); Psychology of Totalitarianism, (2022); Responsible Artificial Intelligence how to Develop and Use AI in A Responsible Way, (2019); Rules of Sociological Method, (1982)","","University of Ljubljana Faculty of Public Administration","25912240; 25912259","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008540686"

Although previous studies have highlighted CSR attributes in the hospitality industry, few studies have examined the combined effect of multidimensional cruise passengers' engagement to boost cruise performance. Therefore, the current paper examines the impact of initiated and communicated CSR on cruise customers’ cognitive, affective, and conative engagement. Data were collected from 337 reliable questionnaires and then analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling PLS-SEM 4.0 to gain insights into the various relationships and effects. The results suggest that CSR practices significantly impact consumer cognitive and affective engagement and, ultimately, their willingness to have higher conative engagement with cruise operations. Additionally, findings reveal that digital communication will likely mediate the impact of unidimensional CSR practices on multidimensional consumer engagement. However, the evidence-based study supports the potential of larger sharing, a high growth profile, and greater cross-buying engagement with cruise lines.","Consumer Engagement; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Communication; Hospitality Operations; Hotel Cruise","","","Abuhjeeleh, Mohammad, Interactive eWOM, consumer engagement, loyalty, eWOM sharing, and purchase behaviour nexus: an integrated framework for tourism and hospitality industry, International Journal of Services Operations and Informatics, 12, 3, pp. 267-284, (2023); Ahmad, Naveed, Sustainable pathways: the intersection of CSR, hospitality and the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, Current Issues in Tourism, 27, 22, pp. 3924-3943, (2024); Ahn, Jiseon, Examining the relative role of CSR activity and service experience on cruise customers’ behavior, Social Responsibility Journal, 18, 3, pp. 453-468, (2022); Ahn, Jiseon, Different role of hotel CSR activities in the formation of customers’ brand loyalty, International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 12, 3, pp. 337-353, (2020); Ahn, Jiseon, Exploring the role of intrinsic and extrinsic CSR attributes for customers’ positive behavioural intention in the hotel industry, Social Responsibility Journal, 18, 3, pp. 663-678, (2022); Al-Badarneh, Mohammad Bader, An Analytical Study of Job Turnover in the Tour Guidance Profession in Jordan, Dirasat: Human and Social Sciences, 51, 5, pp. 451-463, (2024); Marketing, (2019); Ayvaz-Cavdaroglu, Nur, Empirical Evidence of Revenue Management in the Cruise Line Industry, Journal of Travel Research, 58, 1, pp. 104-120, (2019); Bigné, Enrique, Harnessing stakeholder input on Twitter: A case study of short breaks in Spanish tourist cities, Tourism Management, 71, pp. 490-503, (2019); Bialkova, Svetlana, Campaign participation, spreading electronic word of mouth, purchase: how to optimise corporate social responsibility, CSR, effectiveness via social media?, European Journal of Management and Business Economics, 30, 1, pp. 108-126, (2021)","","Universidade de Aveiro","16459261; 21821453","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006856172"

Meanwhile, from the perspective of speed and amount of value realization, the authors also identify two sets of shift parameters that reduce or increase incentive gap between short-career-horizon CEOs and long-career-horizon CEOs. Specifically considering the digital trend in China and the heterogeneity of firms and industries, this study aims to examine the moderating effects of firm digitalization, industrial digital transformation, slack resources and polluting firms. Design/methodology/approach: In the context of China’s transitional economy, this study uses all A-share listed companies in China from 2007 to 2021, resulting in a total of 4,286 companies with 29,310 company-year observations. Findings: The results support the hypothesis that CEO career horizon significantly facilitates green innovation at the firm level. The positive effect is attenuated by both firm digitalization and industrial digital transformation, but is amplified by slack resources and by the polluting firms. After a series of robustness tests, the research conclusions remain valid. Originality/value: To extend the upper echelons perspective of existing research into CEO−green innovation, the authors make important contributions in four ways. First, this study contributes to green innovation literature by adding an unexplored yet increasingly important managerial determinant. Second, it advances research on the role of the CEO in green innovation by revealing a new theoretical mechanism. Third, it deepens the understanding of CEO career horizon by exploring its influence on innovations in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Fourth, it identifies boundary conditions that motivate CEOs in distinguishable ways, to provide a nuanced understanding of the relationship between CEO career horizon and green innovation.","Ceo Career Horizon; Digitalization; Duality Of Green Innovation; Incentive Gap; Short-termism; Tolerance For Risk; Upper Echelons Theory","","Funding : This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72372068).","Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Arena, Claudia, Big Egos Can Be Green: A Study of CEO Hubris and Environmental Innovation, British Journal of Management, 29, 2, pp. 316-336, (2018); Barbieri, Nicolò, Knowledge sources and impacts on subsequent inventions: Do green technologies differ from non-green ones?, Research Policy, 49, 2, (2020); Bellemare, Marc F., Lagged explanatory variables and the estimation of causal effect, Journal of Politics, 79, 3, pp. 949-963, (2017); Berrone, Pascual, Necessity as the mother of 'green' inventions: Institutional pressures and environmental innovations, Strategic Management Journal, 34, 8, pp. 891-909, (2013); Bertrand, Marianne, Enjoying the quiet life?

However, in the process of digital transformation, enterprises have problems such as” unable to change,”” do not want to change” and” dare not change”. By fulfilling their social responsibilities, they can help enterprises obtain external resources, deal with stakeholder relations, and cope with the above risks. Therefore, whether enterprises should passively promote the fulfillment of social responsibility in response to digital transformation has become a problem. In view of this, this paper takes multinational listed companies in the A-share market in 2011-2021 as the research object, and analyzes the relationship between digital transformation and CSR fulfillment based on the challenges multinational enterprises face in the context of economic globalization and the trend of digital transformation. The results of the study show that digital transformation of enterprises can significantly promote CSR fulfillment, and the greater the proportion of executives with overseas study backgrounds in enterprises, the more obvious the improvement of CSR fulfillment, while executives with overseas working backgrounds show negative moderating effect in some situations.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Top Management Team; Upper Echelons Theory; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Digital Transformation; External Resources; International Competitions; Multinational Enterprise; Share Market; Social Responsibilities; Top Management Teams; Upper Echelons Theories","Corporate social responsibility; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; External resources; International competitions; Multinational enterprise; Share market; Social responsibilities; Top management teams; Upper echelons theories","","Costa-Climent, Ricardo, Value creation through the evolution of business model themes, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 353-361, (2021); Management World, (2016); Research on Financial Issues, (2020); Nankai Business Review, (2015); Academy of Management Review, (1984); Manag World, (2021); Finance and Trade Research, (2022); China Industrial Economics, (2022); Academy of Management Review, (1979); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1990)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9798400711862","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007536860"

Yet, central registers have become important policy tools for governments in enhancing corporate transparency. We propose a blockchain-based solution that provides a more open, verifiable, and secure framework for registering beneficial ownership information, while ensuring greater transparency and trust. This paper examines the role of blockchain technology within registers of beneficial owners and highlights important implications for the accounting sector. We offer a fresh perspective into how blockchain technology supports company disclosure and contribute new insights into research on ‘digital trust’. This paper bridges the gap between the conceptual and real-world implementation of registers of beneficial owners and promotes a more nuanced understanding on how new digital infrastructures impact accountants' compliance responsibilities.","Accounting; Aml/ctf; Beneficial Ownership; Blockchain; Registers; Trust; Accounting; Aml/ctf; Anti-money Laundering; Beneficial Ownership; Block-chain; Corporates; Policy Tools; Register; Technology Support; Trust; Blockchain; Ownership; Technological Development","Accounting; AML/CTF; Anti-money laundering; Beneficial ownership; Block-chain; Corporates; Policy tools; Register; Technology support; Trust; Blockchain; ownership; technological development","","Acharya, Viral V., A theory of income smoothing when insiders know more than outsiders, Review of Financial Studies, 28, 9, pp. 2534-2574, (2015); Catch Me if You can Gaps in the Register of Overseas Entities, (2023); Albayati, Hayder, Accepting financial transactions using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency: A customer perspective approach, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Angluin, David J.C., Transparency, accounting knowledge and perceived fairness in UK universities' resource allocation: Results from a survey of accounting and finance, British Accounting Review, 32, 1, pp. 1-42, (2000); Attaran, Mohsen, Blockchain technology in healthcare: Challenges and opportunities, International Journal of Healthcare Management, 15, 1, pp. 70-83, (2022); Public Contract Law J, (2021); Baudet, Cédric, The Paradoxes of Trust and Transparency of Blockchain Technologies, Journal of Global Information Management, 31, 5, (2023); Bermeo-Almeida, Oscar Enmanuel, Blockchain in agriculture: A systematic literature review, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 883, pp. 44-56, (2018); Bodkhe, Umesh, BloHosT: Blockchain enabled smart tourism and hospitality management, (2019); Capocasale, Vittorio, Comparative analysis of permissioned blockchain frameworks for industrial applications, Blockchain: Research and Applications, 4, 1, (2023)","","Elsevier Inc.","00401625","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218334855"

Drawing from the natural resource-based view, institutional, stakeholder, and legitimacy theories, this study hypothesizes a positive relationship for the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on Chinese listed firms' CEP, moderated by the roles of state ownership (SOWN) and external stakeholders, i.e., external auditor (BIG4), financial analysts (FA), and media coverage (MC). The study analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 9033 firm-year observations from Chinese A-share listed firms on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges over the period 2010–2019. AI is measured through computer-assisted textual analysis of annual reports, while CEP is quantified using environmental responsibility scores from an independent rating agency (HEXUN-RKS). Employing fixed effects panel regression models, empirical findings reveal a positive and significant relationship between AI and CEP. The results for moderation effects demonstrate that BIG4 and FA significantly strengthen the positive AI–CEP relationship, but MC does not. Moreover, the study's heterogeneity analyses indicate that the positive impact of AI on CEP is more pronounced in decision-effective firms and highly competitive industries. Importantly, the main findings of the study were validated through instrumental variables, lag and lead models, two-step system generalized method of moments, and an alternate proxy for CEP. The study contributes new insights on AI's environmental impacts in emerging economies like China undergoing digital transformation. It highlights how ownership structure and heightened external oversight compel firms to leverage AI for enhancing CEP.","Analysts; Artificial Intelligence; Big4 Audit; Environmental Performance; Media; Artificial Intelligence; Empirical Analysis; Media Role; Stock Market; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","artificial intelligence; empirical analysis; media role; stock market; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","","Ado, Abdullahi Bala, The impact of audit quality on the financial performance of listed companies nigeria, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 9, pp. 37-42, (2020); Agyei-Mensah, Ben Kwame, The effect of audit committee effectiveness and audit quality on corporate voluntary disclosure quality, African Journal of Economic and Management Studies, 10, 1, pp. 17-31, (2019); Apergis, Nicholas, ESG scores and cost of debt, Energy Economics, 112, (2022); Aragón-Correa, Juan Alberto Alberto, A contingent resource-based view of proactive corporate environmental strategy, Academy of Management Review, 28, 1, pp. 71-88, (2003); Arellano, Manuel, Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Bacha, Sami, CSR performance and the cost of debt: does audit quality matter?, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 21, 1, pp. 137-158, (2021); Bai, Chunguang, Improving green flexibility through advanced manufacturing technology investment: Modeling the decision process, International Journal of Production Economics, 188, pp. 86-104, (2017); Bendig, David, Digital orientation and environmental performance in times of technological change, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 188, (2023); Benzidia, Smail, The impact of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on green supply chain process integration and hospital environmental performance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 165, (2021); Blundell, Richard W., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, 1, pp. 115-143, (1998)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217064535"

As there is less number of patients, the drug manufacturing companies are not keen in producing these drugs. Due to high costs of research and development and low profitability, companies do not want to invest in manufacturing of orphan drugs. Several laws have been passed by Governments of different nations to encourage the development of orphan drugs and make it available to patients. This study explores the interrelation dynamics of factors that has resulted in the greater availability of orphan drugs in recent times. Ten factors: internet technology, legislation, online patient support groups, government subsidiary, biotechnological advancements, corporate social responsibility, awareness and diagnosis of rare diseases and exclusive budgeting by pharmaceutical industries for orphan drugs related research and development and production were taken for the study. With a sample size of 38 experts, the technique of decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was used for the study.

Corporate digital responsibility focuses on the social responsibility that businesses should fulfill when using digital technology, which can promote sustainable development of the enterprise. Therefore, based on the theoretical framework of dynamic capability theory and sensemaking theory, this article constructs a research model between corporate digital responsibility and responsible entrepreneurship. Based on 391 data collected from China through a questionnaire survey method, after preliminary analysis using SPSS 26.0, the structural equation model (SEM) was tested using Mplus 8.7, and we have confirmed that high-quality digital transformation is beneficial for enterprises to better stimulate responsible entrepreneurial spirit through organizational meaning shaping when fulfilling digital responsibilities. The unique contribution of this article lies in combining it with responsible entrepreneurship from the perspective of technological ethics, broadening the research perspective of corporate technological ethics, establishing and verifying the inherent connection between corporate digital responsibility and responsible entrepreneurship, and providing new ideas for the application of corporate technological ethics in practice.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Organizational Sensemaking; Responsible Entrepreneurship; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporates; Digital Technologies; Digital Transformation; Organisational; Organizational Sensemaking; Responsible Entrepreneurship; Sense Making; Structural Equation Models; Technical Applications","Corporate digital responsibility; Corporates; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Organisational; Organizational sensemaking; Responsible entrepreneurship; Sense making; Structural equation models; Technical applications","","Dörr, Saskia, AI Demands Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR): Aligning the Moral Compass for Workers in AI-Enabled Workplaces, pp. 37-45, (2023); Liyanaarachchi, Gajendra, Market-oriented corporate digital responsibility to manage data vulnerability in online banking, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 39, 4, pp. 571-591, (2020); Mullins, Martin, Creating ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence and big data analytics customers: The case of the consumer European insurance market, Patterns, 2, 10, (2021); Ed-Dafali, Slimane, Strategic orientations, organizational ambidexterity, and sustainable competitive advantage: Mediating role of industry 4.0 readiness in emerging markets, Journal of Cleaner Production, 401, (2023); Fuller, Ted, Social and symbolic capital and responsible entrepreneurship: An empirical investigation of SME narratives, Journal of Business Ethics, 67, 3, pp. 287-304, (2006); Adomako, Samuel, Doing well and being responsible: The impact of corporate social responsibility legitimacy on responsible entrepreneurship, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 30, 4, pp. 1794-1804, (2023); Elliott, Karen, Implementing corporate digital responsibility (CDR): Tackling wicked problems for the digital era: Pilot study insights, Organizational Dynamics, 53, 2, (2024); Becker, Sarah J., A Code of Digital Ethics: laying the foundation for digital ethics in a science and technology company, AI and Society, 38, 6, pp. 2629-2639, (2023); MIT Sloan Management Review, (2020); Cheng, Cong, Conceptualizing Corporate Digital Responsibility: A Digital Technology Development Perspective, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","14727978","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007147495"

This study proposes a composite econometric model to assess the sustainability performance of companies in the construction sector in a digital context, a domain that remains underexplored despite its substantial economic and environmental impact. Drawing on a sample of 1600 Romanian construction companies over ten years (2013–2023), this study develops a multidimensional sustainability score and tests its financial drivers using ordinary least squares regression models. The model incorporates nine financial structure variables as predictors of sustainability outcomes across three dimensions—financial, social, and environmental—while ensuring robustness through heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity diagnostics. The results show that indicators such as the return on assets, debt ratio, and equity structure significantly influence sustainability performance, particularly in the financial and environmental dimensions. In contrast, the social dimension exhibits lower explanatory power. The findings suggest that financial resilience plays a critical role in shaping sustainable practices in the construction industry and support the adoption of integrated models for performance benchmarking and policy alignment.","Construction Industry; Corporate Sustainability; Econometric Model; Environmental Performance; Financial Indicators; Benchmarking; Construction Industry; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Activity; Environmental Indicator; Financial System; Industrial Performance; Sustainability","benchmarking; construction industry; corporate social responsibility; economic activity; environmental indicator; financial system; industrial performance; sustainability","","Siew, Renard Yung Jhien R., The relationship between sustainability practices and financial performance of construction companies, Smart and Sustainable Built Environment, 2, 1, pp. 6-27, (2013); Zhou, Li, Sustainability performance evaluation in industry by composite sustainability index, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 14, 5, pp. 789-803, (2012); Sustainability Indicators and Sustainability Performance Management, (2002); Marcis, Jaqueline, Sustainability performance evaluation of agricultural cooperatives’ operations: a systemic review of the literature, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 21, 3, pp. 1111-1126, (2019); Bǎtrâncea, Ioan, Econometric modeling of SME performance.

While research has suggested that there are associations between BMI and corporate social responsibility (CSR), as well as between BMI and firm performance (FP), we lack theoretical substantiation and empirical verification of these relationships. This study proposes that BMI mediates the link between CSR and FP. This research aims to investigate the mediating role of BMI between various aspects of CSR, introduced by Carroll, and the performance of medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Iran. To achieve the research aim, 483 questionnaires were gathered from SMEs in Iran. To evaluate the conceptual model’s validity, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. The results of this study show that BMI mediates the relationship between all the aspects of CSR introduced by Carroll and FP and only does not mediate the relationship between the environmental dimension and FP. As far as we know, this investigation is among the earliest to explore the relationship between BMI and CSR dimensions through mediation. In response to the increasing significance of environmental issues, this research incorporates a fresh element, namely environmental responsibility, into Carroll’s model. Managers can gain a better understanding of CSR and its impact on FP from the results of this research. This study reveals that managers emphasize certain aspects of CSR which can influence BMI and FP.","Business Model Innovation (bmi); Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Firm Performance; Iran; Iranian Smes; Business Model Innovation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Performance; Innovation Performance; Iran; Iranian Successful Performance For Medium-size Enterprise; Medium Size Enterprise; Performance","Business model innovation; Corporate social responsibility; Firm Performance; Innovation performance; Iran; Iranian successful performance for medium-size enterprise; Medium size enterprise; Performance","","Zott, Christoph, The business model: Recent developments and future research, Journal of Management, 37, 4, pp. 1019-1042, (2011); Magretta, Joan, Why business models matter, Harvard Business Review, 80, 5, pp. 86-87, (2002); Remané, Gerrit, The Business Model Pattern Database-A Tool For Systematic Business Model Innovation, International Journal of Innovation Management, 21, 1, (2017); Hu, Baoliang, How corporate social responsibility influences business model innovation: The mediating role of organizational legitimacy, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 7, (2020); Sun, Jialu, Entrepreneurial environment, market-oriented strategy, and entrepreneurial performance: A study of Chinese automobile firms, Internet Research, 26, 2, pp. 546-562, (2016); Anwar, Muhammad, Business model innovation and SMEs performance-Does competitive advantage mediate?, International Journal of Innovation Management, 22, 7, (2018); Saebi, Tina, What Drives Business Model Adaptation?

This study utilized a dataset comprising Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2023 to explore how environmental uncertainty affects the correlation between digital transformation and ESG performance. Furthermore, we also examined potential pathways and heterogeneity. Our findings demonstrate that digital transformation significantly enhances ESG performance, with the positive effects persisting for up to three years post-implementation, although gradually diminishing in intensity. However, environmental uncertainty substantially reduces this positive impact across all pivotal technologies. Improvements in ESG performance are more pronounced in firms that are high-tech, technology-intensive, and capital-intensive and that do not produce heavy pollution. Quantile regression reveals that firms in the upper–middle ESG performance range benefit most. Our mediation analysis confirms that digital transformation enhances ESG performance by increasing firm value, media attention, and analyst coverage. Overall, this study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence of the impacts of environmental uncertainty. These findings provide strategic guidance for companies navigating digital transformation initiatives in turbulent business environments, while also offering concrete recommendations for regulatory authorities developing ESG disclosure frameworks and digital infrastructure investment priorities tailored to different uncertainty conditions.","Digital Transformation; Environmental Uncertainty; Esg; Heterogeneity; Business Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Impact; Heterogeneity; Industrial Investment; Industrial Performance; Uncertainty Analysis","business development; corporate social responsibility; environmental impact; heterogeneity; industrial investment; industrial performance; uncertainty analysis","","Environmental Social and Governance Esg Investing an Evaluation of the Evidence, (2019); Ebert, Christof, Digital Transformation, IEEE Software, 35, 4, pp. 16-21, (2018); Jones, Matthew D., Past, present, and future barriers to digital transformation in manufacturing: A review, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 60, pp. 936-948, (2021); Manag World, (2021); Sergei, Titov, Digital transformation enablers in high-tech and low-tech companies: A comparative analysis, Australian Journal of Management, 48, 4, pp. 801-843, (2023); Yang, Yang, Digital transformation, financing constraints, and corporate environmental, social, and governance performance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 30, 6, pp. 3189-3202, (2023); Wang, Quanjing, Impact of digital transformation on performance of environment, social, and governance: Empirical evidence from China, Business Ethics, the Environment and Responsibility, 32, 4, pp. 1373-1388, (2023); Review of Industrial Economics, (2023); Govindarajan, Vijayaraghavan, Appropriateness of accounting data in performance evaluation: An empirical examination of environmental uncertainty as an intervening variable, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 9, 2, pp. 125-135, (1984); Mu, Wen, Environment uncertainty, accounting information quality and inefficient investment, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1629, 1, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006560082"

This research investigates the influence of informational and emotional DSR content on consumer perceptions and behavioral outcomes through two experimental studies. Study 1 employed a one-factor between-subjects design (informational vs. emotional) with 50 participants in each condition. Study 2 utilized a 2 × 2 factorial design (content type: informational vs. emotional; product quality certification: present vs. absent), with 50 participants assigned to each of the four conditions. The results demonstrate that informational content significantly enhances consumers' perceptions of competence and positively influences purchase intentions. In contrast, emotional content primarily evokes perceptions of warmth but does not directly impact purchase intentions. However, the presence of product quality certification amplifies the effectiveness of emotional content, creating a “warm glow” effect that enhances warmth perceptions and fosters consumer engagement. These findings underscore the importance of combining emotional content with informational details, such as time, place, amount, and channel, to balance warmth and competence in DSR communications. By integrating the Stereotype Content Model and the “warm glow” effect into DSR research, this study provides theoretical advancements and practical insights for optimizing DSR-related interactive content strategies to maximize consumer engagement and purchase behavior.","Dsr-related Interactive Content; Emotional; Informational; Perceived Competence; Perceived Warmth; Product Quality Certification; Adult; Behavior; Consumer Attitude; Emotion; Female; Human; Male; Social Responsibility; Young Adult; Adult; Consumer Behavior; Emotions; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Social Responsibility; Young Adult","adult; behavior; consumer attitude; emotion; female; human; male; social responsibility; young adult; Adult; Consumer Behavior; Emotions; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Social Responsibility; Young Adult","We appreciate the efforts of all the authors of this article.

However, research has not adequately explored the relationship between digital transformation and corporate environmental responsibility (CER), specifically the mediating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and the moderating effect of environmental regulation intensity. This study addressed this gap by examining how digital transformation influences CER in traditional manufacturing firms. The study considered ESG performance as a mediator and environmental regulation intensity as a moderator. We used panel data from 10,197 annual observations of A-share listed companies in 11 traditional manufacturing industries on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in China from 2012 to 2022. The data included fixed-effect regressions and robustness checks, as well as econometric models. The findings confirmed that digital transformation had a significant positive effect on CER. ESG performance mediates this relationship, enhancing the impact of digital transformation on CER. Additionally, environmental regulation intensity positively moderates this relationship, strengthening the effect of digital transformation on CER. Heterogeneity analysis revealed that the positive effects were more pronounced in state-owned enterprises and the consumer goods and life sciences manufacturing sectors. These results indicate that digital transformation enhanced resource utilization efficiency, promoted green innovation, and improved CER, especially when supported by strong ESG performance and robust environmental regulations. The study offered practical insights for managers and policymakers to align digital transformation initiatives with environmental objectives, fostering sustainable development.","Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Environmental Regulation Intensity; Esg Performance; Quality Productive Forces; Traditional Manufacturing; Corporate Environmental Responsibilities; Digital Transformation; Environmental Regulation Intensity; Environmental Responsibility; Environmental, Social, And Governance Performance; Manufacturing Enterprise; Mediating Roles; Performance; Quality Productive Force; Traditional Manufacturing; Smart Manufacturing","Corporate environmental responsibilities; Digital transformation; Environmental regulation intensity; Environmental responsibility; Environmental, social, and governance performance; Manufacturing enterprise; Mediating roles; Performance; Quality productive force; Traditional manufacturing; Smart manufacturing","Funding text 1: The advent of new productive forces, marked by advancements in information technology, biology, energy, and materials, has significantly heightened the focus on corporate digital transformation (CDT) and social responsibility (Dal Mas et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023; Wang and Han, 2024). These transformative technologies are characterized by deep integration, high complexity, and multipoint breakthroughs (Wang and Hou, 2024). They drive the continuous optimization of production tools, equipment, methods, and resource allocation strategies (Wang and Esperan\u00E7a, 2023). Underpinned by digitalization, networking, and technological innovation, this \u201Cnew-quality productivity\u201D positions data as a key production factor (Zheng and Zhang, 2023). Digital transformation enhances resilience, flexibility, and adaptability in traditional manufacturing enterprises, enabling stability during crises and supporting growth (Zhan and Li, 2024). Furthermore, it serves as a driver of innovation and industrial transformation, laying the foundation for long-term competitiveness by aligning investments in digital technologies with strategic objectives (Wang and Shao, 2024).State-owned enterprises enjoy enhanced performance opportunities due to several key factors (Zhan and Li, 2024). Firstly, they are highly attuned to policy directions and receive significant government support for their digital transformation initiatives. Secondly, they have a strong mission to align with national strategies and promote high-quality economic growth. Their prominent positions in various industries enable them to lead by example, influencing the broader digitalization process. Digital transformation has a particularly pronounced impact on consumer goods and life sciences. Consumer goods industry faces increasingly diverse and personalized demands, and digital technologies allow companies to effectively meet these expectations. Additionally, branding and marketing practices have evolved; companies leverage digital tools such as social media to enhance brand awareness and foster consumer loyalty through interactive experiences. In life sciences, characterized by long research and development cycles and high costs, digital transformation enhances efficiency and innovation. Technologies such as artificial intelligence speed up drug development, while production complexities demand stringent quality control (Trukhachev and Dzhikiya, 2023). Digital tools facilitate real-time monitoring, ensuring high production standards. Furthermore, the life sciences sector requires transparent and flexible supply chains.

Drawing upon the behavioral theory of the firm, this study aims to investigate how operational risks faced by agriculture-related firms affect its CSR practices. Design/methodology/approach: Using a data of 136 Chinese food processing firms with 909 observations from 2011 to 2021, this study constructs the fixed-effect model to analyze the relationship among operational risks, digital investment and CSR practices. Findings: The empirical evidence shows that competition risk significantly improves CSR performance while financial risk hinders it. The results of moderation analysis further reveal that digital investment strengthens the positive effect of competition risk and the negative effect of financial risk, although the latter is not statistically significant. Originality/value: Overall, by establishing a link between operational risks and CSR practices, this study contributes to clarifying decision-making rules for food processing firms and deepening the understanding of why and when they adopt social responsibility initiatives.","Csr Practices; Digital Investment; Food Processing Firms; Operational Risk; Agricultural Sector; Competition Risks; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility Practice; Digital Investment; Financial Risks; Food Processing Firm; Operational Risks; Performance; Public Concern; Food Industry","Agricultural sector; Competition risks; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility practice; Digital investment; Financial risks; Food processing firm; Operational risks; Performance; Public concern; Food industry","Funding: This work is supported by the Major program of National Social Science Foundation of China (22&ZD082).","Alessandri, Todd M., Managerial incentives, myopic loss aversion, and firm risk: A comparison of family and non-family firms, Journal of Business Research, 91, pp. 19-27, (2018); Barnett, Michael L., Does it pay to be really good? addressing the shape of the relationship between social and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 33, 11, pp. 1304-1320, (2012); Benitez, Jose, How corporate social responsibility activities influence employer reputation: The role of social media capability, Decision Support Systems, 129, (2020); Snack Food Industry is Facing Problems Such as Homogenization how do Enterprises Break the Game, (2021); Chen, Yichun, The effect of mandatory CSR disclosure on firm profitability and social externalities: Evidence from China, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 65, 1, pp. 169-190, (2018); Chin, Tachia, Leveraging blockchain technology for green innovation in ecosystem-based business models: A dynamic capability of values appropriation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 183, (2022); Comin, Diego A., Diverging trends in aggregate and firm volatility, Review of Economics and Statistics, 88, 2, pp. 374-383, (2006); Dong, Lingxiu, Impact of Traceability Technology Adoption in Food Supply Chain Networks, Management Science, 69, 3, pp. 1518-1535, (2023); Duanmu, Jinglin, Does market competition dampen environmental performance?

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 311 employees of ISO-14001-certified manufacturing firms in Pakistan. Both symmetrical partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and asymmetrical fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) methods were applied to test the proposed hypotheses to enhance the robustness of the results. Findings: PLS-SEM results discovered that all dimensions of TQM, like process management, leadership, human resource management, customer focus, information and analysis and strategic planning, foster the OCBE through the mediation role of ECSR. The robustness of the findings was manifold when fsQCA results complemented the results by discovering that all six dimensions have been identified as sufficient conditions and some as necessary conditions to drive the OCBE. Originality/value: The theoretical contribution of this study sheds light on TQM's function in boosting OCBE through the mediation of ECSR. Practically, the business managers may utilise TQM as a strategy to foster the OCBE in order to mitigate environmental damages of their organisations’ operations by instilling OCBE among the employees.","Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Fsqca; Organisational Citizenship Behaviour For Environment; Total Quality Management; Digital Storage; Environmental Management; Human Resource Management; Information Management; Least Squares Approximations; 'current; Asymmetrical Effects; Condition; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Organizational Citizenship Behavior For Environment; Organizational Citizenship Behaviors; Partial Least-squares; Structural Equation Models; Total Quality Management","Digital storage; Environmental management; Human resource management; Information management; Least squares approximations; 'current; Asymmetrical effects; Condition; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental corporate social responsibility; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Organizational citizenship behavior for environment; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Partial least-squares; Structural equation models; Total quality management","Since submission of this article, the following author(s) have updated their affiliation(s): Munir A.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper manually collects environmental cost data and measures corporate digital transformation constructed through a machine learning word vector (Word2Vec) technology approach based on the text information of annual reports (MD&A) for heavily polluting firms. Findings: Corporate digital transformation has a significant inhibitory effect on the internalisation of corporate environmental costs. This is because low-level digital transformation has crowded out cash flows, preventing China’s heavily polluting firms from having the extra capacity needed to internalise environmental costs. This crowding-out effect emerges when companies face problems such as capital shortages, short-term profit pressure and intense market competition. These results have the following important implications. Practical implications: The research highlights the need for enterprises to align digital transformation and sustainability strategies by strengthening resource endowment and optimising internal resource allocation. This requires effective use of digital technology and a long-term sustainability vision for heavily polluting firms facing environmental policy pressures. Social implications: Enterprises should assume more social responsibility and achieve sustainable socioeconomic development. It will also help mitigate the adverse environmental externalities stemming from their operations. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study considers the impact of enterprise digital transformation on the internalisation level of enterprise environmental costs for the first time and uses enterprises’ financial, management, market characteristics and ownership characteristics to analyse the impact mechanism.","Cashflow; Digital Transformation; Heavily Polluting Firms; Internalisation Level Of Corporate Environmental Costs","","This work was funded by Guizhou Colleges and Universities Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project, 2024RW118, Research on Digital transformation Enabling high-quality development of enterprises in Guizhou.","Amit, Raphael, Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); East China Economic Management, (2022); Bharadwaj, Anandhi S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 24, 1, pp. 169-193, (2000); Bianchi, Guia, Organizational Learning for Environmental Sustainability: Internalizing Lifecycle Management, Organization and Environment, 35, 1, pp. 103-129, (2022); Bithas, Kostas P., Sustainability and externalities: Is the internalization of externalities a sufficient condition for sustainability?, Ecological Economics, 70, 10, pp. 1703-1706, (2011); Brunetti, Federico, Digital transformation challenges: strategies emerging from a multi-stakeholder approach, TQM Journal, 32, 4, pp. 697-724, (2020); Cai, Xiang, Can direct environmental regulation promote green technology innovation in heavily polluting industries?

Findings: There is strong evidences that the sales and productivity performance of SMEs are positively affected by DM. Furthermore, there is evidence that corporate social responsibility plays an important role in moderating the influence of DM on SME performance. Originality/value: This finding suggests that entrepreneurs should carefully consider using digital technologies to create DM strategies.

This corporate behaviour, defined as machinewashing, in an attempt to empower engagement processes in the stakeholders’ network and satisfy stakeholder expectations with regard to the ethical implications of the use of artificial intelligence, has, in the final instance, the prevailing purpose of achieving better levels of corporate performance and reputation. However, thus far, scholars have not provided any empirical studies on the existence of corporate machinewashing strategies, and there is a significant lack of clarity as to how to measure machinewashing. Utilising the corporate digital responsibility theory, this paper offers an original methodological contribution to the nascent research field dedicated to machinewashing behaviour. Particularly, this paper provides considerations for detecting machinewashing through an analysis based on the comparison between the information capacity of the reporting and the information reliability level as a proxy for machinewashing strategies and, thus, for the real impact of digitalisation strategies on stakeholders. To this end, we conducted an exploratory content analysis of the reports of 10 Italian-listed companies from 10 different industries. Overall, looking at the gap between what companies say about the impact of digitalisation from an ethical perspective, and what really happens, our results define a possible path for identifying machinewashing, the fields where it happens and the practices that companies use in order to realise these strategies.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digital Ethics; Exploratory Content Analysis; Machinewashing; Stakeholder Engagement","","This work is supported by the University of Pisa under the \u2018PRA \u2013 Progetti di Ricerca di Ateneo\u2019 (Institutional Research Grants) \u2013 Project no.

This study analyzes A-share listed companies in China from 2007 to 2021, utilizing the 2018 China Supply Chain Innovation and Application Pilot Policy as a quasi-natural experiment. Our findings indicate that supply chain digitization facilitates green innovation through digital transformation, reducing corporate carbon emissions. Notably, the decrease in Scope 3 carbon emissions induced by supply chain digitization is significantly greater than the overall reduction in carbon emissions. At the same time, supply chain digitalization reduces the carbon emissions of the core enterprise's suppliers, but it does not have a significant effect on the carbon emissions of its customers. This effect is especially pronounced in low-pollution industries, businesses with high supplier and customer concentrations, and companies with previously low carbon emissions. This research enriches the literature on supply chains and corporate carbon emissions and provides valuable insights for businesses, guiding the implementation of digital supply chains and low-carbon strategies.","Carbon Emissions; Digital Transformation; Green Innovation; Supply Chain Digitization; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Sequestration; Green Development; Carbon Emissions; Chain Digitisation; Corporate Performance; Corporates; Digital Transformation; Digitisation; Green Innovations; Supply Chain Applications; Supply Chain Digitization; Supply Chain Innovations; Low Emission; Carbon; Carbon Emission; Corporate Strategy; Digitization; Industrial Emission; Innovation; Research Work; Supply Chain Management; Article; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Clinical Research; Commercial Phenomena; Concentration Process; Consumer; Controlled Study; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technology; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Energy Consumption; Green Chemistry; Industry; Manager; Measurement Error; Mediation Analysis; Methodology; Supply Chain; China; Carbon; Industry","Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration; Green development; Carbon emissions; Chain digitisation; Corporate performance; Corporates; Digital transformation; Digitisation; Green innovations; Supply chain applications; Supply chain digitization; Supply chain innovations; Low emission; carbon; carbon emission; corporate strategy; digitization; industrial emission; innovation; research work; supply chain management; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; clinical research; commercial phenomena; concentration process; consumer; controlled study; corporate social responsibility; digital technology; digital transformation; digitalization; energy consumption; green chemistry; industry; manager; measurement error; mediation analysis; methodology; supply chain; China; Carbon; Industry","","Ali, Abdul, Market-driven entrepreneurship and institutions, Journal of Business Research, 113, pp. 117-128, (2020); Bag, Surajit, Big data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies based collaborative platform empowering absorptive capacity in health care supply chain: An empirical study, Journal of Business Research, 154, (2023); Chen, Meng, The impact of supply chain concentration on integration and business performance, International Journal of Production Economics, 257, (2023); Chen, Yujing, Analysis on the evolution of shipping logistics service supply chain market structure under the application of blockchain technology, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 53, (2022); Cui, Jingbo, The effectiveness of China’s regional carbon market pilots in reducing firm emissions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 52, (2021); Valle Enrique, Daisy, Being digital and flexible to navigate the storm: How digital transformation enhances supply chain flexibility in turbulent environments, International Journal of Production Economics, 250, (2022); Fan, Wei, Digitalization drives green transformation of supply chains: a two-stage evolutionary game analysis, Annals of Operations Research, (2024); Guo, Qiaozhe, How does green digitalization affect environmental innovation?

They play a significant role in meeting stakeholder expectations, enhancing brand reputation, attracting investment and talent, driving innovation and value creation, and fulfilling social and environmental responsibilities. Using panel data from Chinese listed companies between 2009 and 2021, this study utilizes the new environmental air quality standards (NEAQS) policy as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the impact of environmental regulatory policy on corporate ESG ratings in the context of the digital economy. This study finds that environmental regulation policies enhance corporate ESG ratings, with a latecomer advantage in the digital economy. Mechanism analysis indicates that promoting digital transformation, fostering green innovation, and increasing environmental costs are important mechanisms through which the NEAQS policy enhances corporate ESG ratings. Heterogeneity analysis shows that, in the context of digital economic development, companies with lower levels of digital transformation, asset intensity, and financing constraints have a latecomer advantage and can elevate corporate ESG ratings more effectively through digital transformation under environmental regulatory policies. This study provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between environmental regulatory policies and corporate ESG ratings and offers policy support for other countries seeking to enhance corporate social responsibility through environmental regulatory policies in the digital economy.","Corporate Esg; Digital Economy; Environmental Regulatory Policy; Latecomer Advantage; Circular Economy; Brand Reputation; Corporate Environmental, Social, And Governance; Corporates; Digital Economy; Digital Transformation; Environmental Regulatory Policy; Latecomer Advantages; Quality Standard; Regulatory Policies; Value Creation; Green Economy; Air Quality; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Environmental Economics; Environmental Policy; Panel Data; Regulatory Framework; Standard (regulation); China","Circular economy; Brand reputation; Corporate environmental, social, and governance; Corporates; Digital economy; Digital transformation; Environmental regulatory policy; Latecomer advantages; Quality standard; Regulatory policies; Value creation; Green economy; air quality; corporate social responsibility; digitization; environmental economics; environmental policy; panel data; regulatory framework; standard (regulation); China","This study was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Program of Guizhou Colleges and Universities, Research on Digital Transformation Enabling High-Quality Development of Guizhou Enterprises (2024RW118).","Aluchna, Maria, Do institutional investors encourage firm to social disclosure?

Using manually collected data, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach to examine how firms’ targeted pairing assistance with counties affects DFI. Our results show that firms’ pairing assistance, an innovative CSR practice, can significantly improve DFI in recipient counties. This remains robust after considering two-way fixed effects (TWFE) potential bias, endogeneity issues and robustness checks. Mechanism analysis shows that firms can leverage their financial expertise and CSR experience to broaden DFI coverage, while those with digitalization capabilities further advance the digitalization process. We also uncover pairing firms’ alignment—through industry synergy and regional complementarity—which improves the impact of TPA on DFI.

However, the mediating role of customer experience in linking online banking service clues to satisfaction remains underexplored. Grounded in Haeckel’s model, this study examines how functional (technical execution), mechanic (interface usability), and humanic (behavioral interactions) service clues shape satisfaction among 400 individual and corporate online banking users in Northern Cyprus, analyzed via Structural Equation Modelling. By framing age and occupation as proxies for risk aversion and post-crisis distrust—key barriers in Cyprus’s banking sector—this study advances regionally tailored strategies for sustainable digital adoption. The results reveal functional clues positively impacted satisfaction only for individual customers, while mechanic clues enhanced satisfaction across both groups, contributing to sustainable development. Humanic clues showed no significant effect. Although online service clues improved overall customer experience, a key corporate social responsibility, this experience did not mediate the clue–satisfaction relationship. Demographic factors (e.g., age, user type) moderated these dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mechanic and functional clues in digital banking interfaces to bolster satisfaction and align with sustainable development goals. This study advances Haeckel’s theory in digital contexts and offers actionable insights for banks seeking to balance technological innovation with customer centricity.","Corporate Social Responsibilities; Customer Experience; Customer Satisfaction; Functional Clues; Haeckel’s Model; Humanic Clues; Mechanic Clues; Online Banking; Service Clues; Sustainable Development; Banking; Corporate Social Responsibility; Demographic Method; Innovation; Sustainable Development Goal; Technological Development; Technology Adoption; Cyprus; Northern Cyprus","banking; corporate social responsibility; demographic method; innovation; Sustainable Development Goal; technological development; technology adoption; Cyprus; Northern Cyprus","","Zeebaree, Mosleh, Impact of innovation technology in enhancing organizational management, Estudios de Economia Aplicada, 38, 4, (2020); Asia Pacific Journal of Management Research and Innovation, (2019); Sleimi, Mohammad Tahseen, E-Banking services quality and customer loyalty: The moderating effect of customer service satisfaction: Empirical evidence from the UAE banking sector, Management Science Letters, 10, 15, pp. 3663-3674, (2020); Almaiah, Mohammed Amin, Factors influencing the adoption of internet banking: An integration of ISSM and UTAUT with price value and perceived risk, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Wiryawan, Drajad, Factors Affecting Digital Banking Customer Satisfaction in Indonesia using D&M Model, (2022); Kne Soc Sci, (2018); Suchánek, Petr, Customer satisfaction, loyalty, knowledge and competitiveness in the food industry, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 32, 1, pp. 1237-1255, (2019); Manyanga, Wilbert, The effect of customer experience, customer satisfaction and word of mouth intention on customer loyalty: The moderating role of consumer demographics, Cogent Business and Management, 9, 1, (2022); Haeckel, Stephan H., How to Lead the Customer Experience, Marketing Management, 12, 1, pp. 18-23, (2003); Technology Acceptance Model Tam, (1989)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003826685"

Using data from Chinese listed companies from 2009 to 2022, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to rigorously assess the impact of the BRI on corporate ESG performance and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicate that the BRI significantly enhances corporate ESG performance, with these results robustly validated through robustness checks. The analysis identifies two primary channels through which the BRI affects ESG performance: internal mechanisms, such as fostering technological innovation and enhancing environmental disclosure, and external mechanisms, including increased analyst attention and the expansion of digital infrastructure. Additionally, we observe significant variation in the BRI’s impact across different industries and firm characteristics. Specifically, non-state-owned enterprises, high-growth companies, large corporations, and those located in economically advanced regions exhibit the most pronounced positive effects. This research not only deepens the understanding of the BRI’s influence on sustainable business practices but also provides valuable insights for policymakers and corporate leaders. By leveraging the BRI, companies can significantly enhance their ESG performance, thus contributing to broader sustainability objectives.

While ethical consumption is widely studied in Western contexts, limited research explores these factors in emerging markets with distinct cultural influences. This study addresses this gap by examining how these elements shape consumer confidence and purchasing behavior. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software, data from 286 customers were analyzed. The results indicate that CSR initiatives and blockchain-enabled transparency significantly enhance consumer trust, which, in turn, positively influences willingness to pay more for local food. Additionally, cultural alignment strengthens consumer confidence, amplifying its mediating role. However, the impact of environmental sustainability on willingness to pay was weaker than expected, suggesting that economic and social factors may have a more pronounced effect in this context. The findings contribute to consumer behavior theory by integrating digital transparency and cultural factors into ethical consumption models. Practically, the study provides strategic insights for local food producers and policymakers, emphasizing the role of trust-building mechanisms in justifying premium pricing. This research advances understanding of ethical consumption in emerging economies and informs sustainable business strategies in the evolving Saudi market.","Blockchain Transparency; Confidence; Cultural Alignment; Ethic; Sustainability; Article; Behavior; Behavior Theory; Blockchain; Catering Service; Consumer Attitude; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Protection; Environmental Sustainability; Exploratory Factor Analysis; Food; Food Industry; Human; Internal Consistency; Internet Of Things; Likert Scale; Purchasing; Purchasing Behavior; Social Aspect; Structural Equation Modeling; Willingness To Pay","Article; behavior; behavior theory; blockchain; catering service; consumer attitude; corporate social responsibility; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; exploratory factor analysis; food; food industry; human; internal consistency; internet of things; Likert scale; purchasing; purchasing behavior; social aspect; structural equation modeling; Willingness To Pay","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Grant No: KFU250815].

It also examines how corporate internal control and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure levels moderate this effect. This study fills a gap in the literature by investigating the impact of digital transformation on business performance, especially in the Chinese context, where digital transformation is rapidly progressing. This study also offers practical guidance for practitioners on whether and how to undergo a digital transformation and enhance their internal governance and social responsibility practices. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 2,637 Chinese A-share nonfinancial listed companies from 2009–2022, after excluding firms with ST, ST* or PT status; negative revenue; and missing data for three or more consecutive years. Digital transformation index data is collected from firms’ annual reports, and the other microlevel data from the Wind and CSMAR databases. The authors winsorize the data at 1% for outliers, resulting in 17,305 firm-year observations. This study uses fixed-effects logistic regression with clustered robust standard errors to analyze the binary dependent variable. This study also performs various robustness checks, such as probit model, multilevel fixed effects model and IV 2SLS estimations, to confirm the validity of the results. Findings: This study reveals that digital transformation leads to standard unqualified audit opinions, meaning that companies that invest more in digital technologies and capabilities has more tendency to receive standard unqualified audit opinions, which signify the reliability and credibility of their financial reporting. This study also finds that corporate internal control and CSR disclosure levels positively moderate the effect of digital transformation on audit opinions. This study further conducts heterogeneity analysis and shows that the positive effect is originated by the state-owned enterprises, firms audited by non-Big4 auditing firms, firms with high internal control levels and firms with low CSR disclosure levels. The results are robust to different econometric methods. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on how digital transformation influences audit quality and credibility and how internal governance and social responsibility practices strengthen this influence. This study also has practical implications for practitioners by providing advice on whether and how to pursue a digital transformation and improve their internal governance and social responsibility practices. This study demonstrates its originality by reviewing the existing literature from three theoretical perspectives: stakeholder, signaling and reputation, and identifying the research gap that the study addresses. This study also compares its findings with previous studies and discusses the implications and limitations of its research. This study also proposes directions for future research based on its findings.","Audit Opinions; Corporate Digital Transformation; Corporate Internal Control; Social Responsibility Disclosure Level","","","Abad, David, Audit opinions and information asymmetry in the stock market, Accounting and Finance, 57, 2, pp. 565-595, (2017); Ahsan, Tanveer, Corporate social responsibility and firm-value: the role of sensitive industries and CEOs power in China, Applied Economics, 54, 16, pp. 1844-1863, (2022); Barr-Pulliam, Dereck, The effects of person-specific, task, and environmental factors on digital transformation and innovation in auditing: A review of the literature, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 33, 2, pp. 337-374, (2022); Bebbington, Jan, Routledge handbook of environmental accounting, pp. 1-438, (2021); Digitalisation and Firm Performance Evidence from Tunisian Smes, (2020); Betti, Nathanaël, Understanding the internal audit function in a digitalised business environment, Journal of Accounting and Organizational Change, 17, 2, pp. 197-216, (2021); Betti, Nathanaël, Effects of digitalisation of organisations on internal audit activities and practices, Managerial Auditing Journal, 36, 6, pp. 872-888, (2021); Bouwman, Harry, The impact of digitalization on business models, Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance, 20, 2, pp. 105-124, (2018); Bozzolan, Saverio, The quality of mandatory non-financial (Risk) disclosures: The moderating role of audit firm and partner characteristics, International Journal of Accounting, (2021); Caputo, Andrea, Digitalization and business models: Where are we going?

The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was applied to analyze 250 valid responses collected from 2,411 commercial bank branches in Southeast Vietnam. Stratified sampling and snowball sampling methods ensured regional representation. The findings reveal that DT directly enhances FP and acts as a key mediator, strengthening the effects of MO and CSR. DT facilitates real-time responsiveness, enhances transparency, and integrates technological advances with market and social strategies.

However, at the micro-level, research in this area is lacking, as attention is scantly paid on the comprehensive capabilities of renewable energy enterprises, their industrial heterogeneity and heterogeneous social connections, including bricolage and utility innovation. Drawing from the social resource-based view theory and institutional theory, the research investigates SOI effect on SVC, the moderating role of social ties (ST) and entrepreneurial bricolage (EB) mediation. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology encompassed several key steps. Initially, a research framework was constructed based on a comprehensive literature review. Subsequently, data were collected by surveying 133 middle to senior-level managers. To assess the proposed hypotheses, a structured equation modeling analysis was conducted using a two-stage approach, which involved partial least squares and hierarchical regression techniques. Findings: The study reveals that SOI affects SVC significantly, and SOI positively impacts EB. Furthermore, political ties strengthen the positive impact of SOI on EB. Moreover, EB positively impacts SVC. Additionally, EB mediates the relationship between SOI and SVC. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, the measurement of variables relies on a subjective approach. Future research could employ a quantitative comprehensive index evaluation method of assessment, thereby providing additional validation for the authors' findings. Secondly, although cross-sectional data can be utilized to explore the relationships between variables, there may be inherent biases in the results. Therefore, longitudinal data collection in future research would enable the observation of the long-term effects of SOI and EB on SVC and ST. Thirdly, it would be beneficial to examine other potential factors that could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms linking SOI to SVC. Practical implications: First, the study underscores the significance of EB in the interplay between SOI and SVC. By embracing innovative approaches and fostering collaborations, SEs can harness EB as a powerful tool for achieving their social missions while overcoming resource constraints. Second, it is imperative for managers to foster a conducive environment for SVC within their organizations, characterized by network ties and partnerships. Simultaneously, they should proactively drive ST initiatives and remain attuned to evolving changes in external environmental laws and regulations. Third, the Malagasy government is actively advocating for social interventions and the establishment of social milieus reminiscent of corporate social responsibility. Social implications: This study emphasizes the importance of ST and recognizes the pivotal role of EB in generating social value within an ecosystem that supports SOI. SEs can create lasting positive impacts on society (e.g. improving access to electricity) by embracing these principles and collaborating with stakeholders. Originality/value: These findings serve to enhance the underlying theoretical context of social entrepreneurship, propose nuanced insight into the methodologies for implementing SVC within the context of renewable energy enterprises and make significant contributions to the ongoing progress of research in the domains of open innovation and social entrepreneurship.","Entrepreneurial Bricolage; Madagascar; Social Open Innovation; Social Ties; Social Value Creation; Social Venture; Digital Storage; Industrial Research; Entrepreneurial Bricolage; Madagascar; Open Innovation; Renewable Energies; Social Open Innovation; Social Ties; Social Value Creation; Social Values; Social Venture; Value Creation; Least Squares Approximations","Digital storage; Industrial research; Entrepreneurial bricolage; Madagascar; Open innovation; Renewable energies; Social open innovation; Social ties; Social value creation; Social values; Social venture; Value creation; Least squares approximations","Funding: This research was funded by Chinese National Social Science Fund (21BGL055).","Journal of Scientific Research and Reports, (2020); Ahn, Joon Mo, Leveraging open innovation to improve society: past achievements and future trajectories, R and D Management, 49, 3, pp. 267-278, (2019); Amezcua, Alejandro S., Organizational sponsorship and founding environments: A contingency view on the survival of business-incubated firms, 1994-2007, Academy of Management Journal, 56, 6, pp. 1628-1654, (2013); Balasubramanian, Sandhya, Does university entrepreneurial orientation matter?

This relationship was more significant under fierce market competition without cyberattacks. This study enriches the literature on the economic impacts of CDT from the perspective of sustainable development and expands the literature on the factors influencing sustainable performance from the perspective of digital technology. It directs the government to advance digital technology, foster a competitive market environment, and enhance cybersecurity, while also serving as a crucial reference for society in driving the reform of CDT, ensuring the sustainable development of the economy and promoting high-quality and sustainable CDT in developing countries, including China.","Corporate Digital Transformation; Cyberattack; Esg Performance; Market Competition; Sustainable Development; Competitiveness; Corporate Strategy; Developing World; Innovation; Market Conditions; Sustainable Development; China","competitiveness; corporate strategy; developing world; innovation; market conditions; sustainable development; China","Wanyi Chen acknowledges financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72102139).","Accenture China Enterprise Digital Transformation Index Report, (2021); Adomako, Samuel, Sustainable environmental strategy, firm competitiveness, and financial performance: Evidence from the mining industry, Resources Policy, 75, (2022); Aftab, Junaid, Environmental ethics, green innovation, and sustainable performance: Exploring the role of environmental leadership and environmental strategy, Journal of Cleaner Production, 378, (2022); Aydoğmuş, Mahmut, Impact of ESG performance on firm value and profitability, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, pp. S119-S127, (2022); Bai, Xuan, Corporate social responsibility and firm performance: The mediating role of marketing competence and the moderating role of market environment, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 32, 2, pp. 505-530, (2015); Bossler, Adam M., Neutralizing Cyber Attacks: Techniques of Neutralization and Willingness to Commit Cyber Attacks, American Journal of Criminal Justice, 46, 6, pp. 911-934, (2021); Oranges Cezarino, Luciana Oranges, Corporate social responsibility in emerging markets: Opportunities and challenges for sustainability integration, Journal of Cleaner Production, 362, (2022); Chang, Taiwei, Corporate sustainable development strategy: Effect of green shared vision on organization members’ behavior, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 7, (2020); Chen, Wanyi, Gimmick or revolution: can corporate digital transformation improve accounting information quality?, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 19, 10, pp. 2966-2990, (2024); Chen, Yushan, Greenwash and Green Trust: The Mediation Effects of Green Consumer Confusion and Green Perceived Risk, Journal of Business Ethics, 114, 3, pp. 489-500, (2013)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000431077"

Subjective norms strongly predict the intention to use food delivery apps, while perceived product risk and sustainability concerns negatively influence adoption. This indicates that consumers valuing social and environmental issues are less likely to use these apps.

The rapid development of emerging technologies has the potential to reshape CSR practices, but little is known about the specific effects on the mining sector. This study investigates how emerging technologies have influenced CSR in 1299 Chinese mining companies from 2010 to 2022. Using fixed-effects regressions, the analysis reveals that the adoption of advanced technologies significantly improves environmental performance by reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. Additionally, these technologies enhance safety standards, leading to a measurable decrease in workplace accidents. However, the study also finds that while technological integration boosts transparency and stakeholder engagement, its impact on long-term social welfare remains mixed. The findings suggest that policy efforts should focus on incentivizing technological innovation while ensuring that CSR frameworks are robust enough to address both environmental and social concerns in the mining industry.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Emerging Technologies; Mining; Advanced Technology; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Emerging Technologies; Environmental Performance; Fixed Effects; Mining Companies; Mining Sector; Social Impact; Specific Effects; Mining Industry; Corporate Social Responsibility; Mining Industry; Regression Analysis; Stakeholder; Technology Adoption; China","Advanced technology; Corporate social responsibility; Digital technologies; Emerging technologies; Environmental performance; Fixed effects; Mining companies; Mining sector; Social impact; Specific effects; Mining industry; corporate social responsibility; mining industry; regression analysis; stakeholder; technology adoption; China","","Adam, Tim René, Why do firms engage in selective hedging?

We adapt the previously described Corporate Digital Responsibility model into a streamlined seven-cluster governance framework that is more directly applicable to these novel organizations. Through a case study, we illustrate the practical value of the conceptual framework and find key points vital for digitally responsible governance by decentralized startups.

Along with businesses transitioning into the innovative digital sphere, ethical issues also appeared. To switch to new technologies, companies must not only be aware of but also engage in digital practices and, last but not least, consider the importance of ethics. Talking about ethics in business is easy since we have a series of guidelines. It becomes more complicated when we face digital ethics and robots that do not have morals. Such a transition requires companies to rethink and innovate their business models and how they offer their customers value, while simultaneously considering digital ethical matters and even environmental and social aspects. This systematic literature review highlights—from the company's perspective—the key topics that characterize digitalization and the crucial role of ethics, describing the internal and external factors to consider in transition processes. The research results propose a series of guidelines but also open up new research opportunities to facilitate the digital transition in the business environment while respecting its ethical aspects.

(GIO)’ presents a novel video learning format for optimizing virtual meetings as well as initial evaluation data on its usefulness and application in an organizational context: the MeetingHacks. Effective collaboration in virtual meetings requires a novel approach to fusing communication and technology. To enhance virtual meetings through accessible digital interventions, we developed MeetingHacks, a series of short videos based on findings of contemporary meeting science. These MeetingHacks address general aspects as well as professional, methodological, social, and proactive aspects of meeting behavior, aligning with the four facets of team skills of the Kassler competence grid. The introductory video, Meetings General, triggers reflective processes to enhance the impact of the subsequent MeetingHacks. Meetings Professional focuses on professional skills, particularly the interplay of problems and solutions and knowledge transfer, drawing on results from interaction analysis and shared mental models. Meetings Structured addresses methodological behavior, emphasizing structured meeting designs. Meetings Social covers prosocial behavior, focusing on making social and informal interaction in virtual meetings more tangible. Meetings Proactive highlights responsibility and proactivity in meetings, informed by interaction analysis and reflection research. The MeetingHacks were implemented over five weeks in a corporate setting and evaluated for their usefulness, applicability, and fit within daily routines. The results demonstrated the benefits and limits of MeetingHacks in an organizational context. Based on this evaluation, this article critically discusses the merits and further development of the MeetingHacks and their effectiveness as a digital intervention.","Digital Intervention; Meeting Crafting; Meetinghacks; Reflection; Video Intervention; Virtual Meetings","","The transformation hub MIAMy\u2014Accelerate Market Introduction of Autonomous Mobility\u2014is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection from the funding announcement \u201CEstablishment and implementation of transformation hubs to support transformation processes in value chains in the automotive industry\u201D with a\u00A0funding amount of 4.9\u202Fmio.

As organizations increasingly prioritize sustainable development, it becomes essential to investigate the role of digital technology in enhancing ESG outcomes. Utilizing data from 35,650 Chinese listed companies spanning 2009 to 2021, this study employs a double fixed-effects model to analyze the dual pathways through which digital technology adoption influences ESG performance. The findings indicate that the adoption of digital technologies positively affects both current and future ESG performance; however, this impact diminishes over time. The breadth and depth of digital technologies offer complementary approaches to improving ESG performance. Specifically, the breadth of digital technologies enhances ESG performance by improving information transparency and alleviating financing constraints, while the depth of digital technologies further bolsters firms’ ESG initiatives by increasing operational efficiency. Additionally, this study reveals significant variations in the impact of digital technologies on ESG performance across different sectors, particularly between manufacturing and highly polluting firms. Notably, the adoption of digital technologies fosters opportunities for the standardization of information regarding firms’ ESG ratings.","Digital Technology Adoption; Esg Performance; Information Transparency; Operating Capacity; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Industrial Performance; Manufacturing; Standardization; Technology Adoption; Transparency","corporate social responsibility; digitization; industrial performance; manufacturing; standardization; technology adoption; transparency","This research was funded by Academic Innovation Team of Capital University of Economics and Business (Grant Number: XSCXTD202404).","undefined; Highlights of the Digital Economy 2024; Du, Xinyi, Promoting enterprise productivity: The role of digital transformation, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, 6, pp. 1165-1181, (2022); Hanelt, Andre, Digital M&A, digital innovation, and firm performance: an empirical investigation, European Journal of Information Systems, 30, 1, pp. 3-26, (2021); Nylén, Daniel, Digital innovation strategy: A framework for diagnosing and improving digital product and service innovation, Business Horizons, 58, 1, pp. 57-67, (2015); Du, Qunyang, Digital technology and ESG performance in ecosystem-based business models: perspective of environmental regulation and green innovation in China, Asia Pacific Business Review, (2024); Wang, Haijun, Digital transformation and manufacturing companies’ ESG responsibility performance, Finance Research Letters, 58, (2023); Wu, Wei, Consortium blockchain-enabled smart ESG reporting platform with token-based incentives for corporate crowdsensing, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 172, (2022); Fang, Zhen, Spatial spillovers and threshold effects of internet development and entrepreneurship on green innovation efficiency in China, Technology in Society, 68, (2022); Liao, Feimei, Digital transformation and corporate green supply chain efficiency: Evidence from China, Economic Analysis and Policy, 81, pp. 195-207, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001111478"

Under the context of the digital era, we examine whether and how social media pressure affects the typical corporate hypocrisy of ESG greenwashing. Using a dataset of A-share listed firms in China from 2011 to 2021, we find that negative sentiment from stock message boards induces firms to engage in ESG greenwashing. Our results are confirmed by an array of robustness tests and additional tests. In addition, the impact of social media pressure is more pronounced in firms with lower market value and poorer reputation. The channel tests show that social media pressure induces ESG greenwashing by exacerbating managerial myopia. Finally, we further find that the shareholding of institutional investors, high-quality audit and local environmental regulation can alleviate this negative impact. Overall, our study demonstrates the mechanism underlying social media pressure on ESG greenwashing and provides practical suggestions for improving the construction of the ESG system.","Corporate Hypocrisy; Esg Greenwashing; Social Media Pressure","","Funding was provided by National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No: 22BGL089).","Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Albuquerque, Rui, Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: Theory and empirical evidence, Management Science, 65, 10, pp. 4451-4469, (2019); Alhouti, Sarah (Sa’arah), Corporate social responsibility authenticity: Investigating its antecedents and outcomes, Journal of Business Research, 69, 3, pp. 1242-1249, (2016); Anantharaman, Divya, Does social responsibility begin at home?

This study empirically examines the impact of digital transformation on enterprises’ social and environmental responsibility and its mechanism. We achieved this through using instrumental variables and DID (Differences-in-Differences)models and selecting the data of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2008 to 2021. The study concludes that an enterprise’s digital transformation positively contributes to the fulfilment of corporate social responsibility. However, the digital transformation of the enterprise has a dampening effect on the fulfilment of the enterprise’s environmental responsibility. Additionally, this effect holds after a series of robustness tests. Further investigation shows that financial constraints have a positive moderating effect on enterprise digital transformation and corporate social responsibility(CSR) and a negative moderating effect on enterprise environmental responsibility. In addition, we found that the impact of enterprise digital transformation on CSR and environmental responsibility varies by firm type. The above studies provide valuable practical experiences for enterprises to achieve green and low-carbon development, reduce environmental pollution, and realize high-quality economic development as well as insight for enterprises and policy implementers.","Article; Decision Making; Digital Transformation; Economic Aspect; Entropy; Human; Mathematical Analysis; Policy; Propensity Score; Quantitative Analysis; Responsibility; Social And Environmental Benefit; Society And Environment; China; Economic Development; Pollution; Prevention And Control; Social Responsibility; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Social Responsibility","Article; decision making; digital transformation; economic aspect; entropy; human; mathematical analysis; policy; propensity score; quantitative analysis; responsibility; social and environmental benefit; society and environment; China; economic development; pollution; prevention and control; social responsibility; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Social Responsibility","","China Industrial Economics, (2022); Oxford Handbook of the Digital Economy, (2012); Tiago, Flávio Gomes Borges, Digital sustainability communication in tourism, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 6, 1, pp. 27-34, (2021); Pan, Wenrong, Digital economy: An innovation driver for total factor productivity, Journal of Business Research, 139, pp. 303-311, (2022); Chen, Chen, The digital economy, spatial spillovers and forestry green total factor productivity, Journal of Cleaner Production, 405, (2023); Guo, Lei, The effects of digital transformation on firm performance: evidence from China’s manufacturing sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 22, (2021); Zhong, Xi, Independent and joint effects of CSR and CSI on the effectiveness of digital transformation for transition economy firms, Journal of Business Research, 156, (2023); Transaction Cost Economics in the Digital Economy A Research Agenda, (2020); Digital Resilience how Work from Home Feasibility Affects Firm Performance, (2021); Goldfarb, Avi, Digital economics, Journal of Economic Literature, 57, 1, pp. 3-43, (2019)","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","40085545","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000474692"

The research critically evaluates Vietnam’s legal framework, including the 2013 Constitution (Article 35), the 2020 Labor Code, and the 2020 Enterprise Law, in alignment with international human rights standards such as the ICESCR, ICCPR, and ILO conventions. Drawing from global best practices, Germany’s Digital Pact for Labor and Japan’s Society 5.0 demonstrate how legal frameworks can balance AI-driven economic transformation with labor protection and human security. Sweden’s CSR model ensures corporate accountability through mandatory reporting and supply chain oversight, while Singapore’s Skills Future initiative offers government-funded reskilling to support workforce adaptation. This study proposes legally binding CSR obligations, fiscal incentives for sustainable employment, enhanced regulatory oversight, and a National Workforce Retraining Fund to align Vietnam’s policies with international labor standards.

However, this theory does not fully explain the mechanisms through which CSR influences corporate innovation, nor does it address how to effectively amplify CSR’s positive impact on innovation. To overcome these limitations, this research aims to incorporate the theories of innovation investment and dynamic capabilities. Innovation investment theory elucidates how CSR can attract additional financing, which can be directed toward innovation activities. Meanwhile, dynamic capabilities theory highlights how digital transformation in enterprises can enhance the positive effects of CSR on innovation, providing insights from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: To demonstrate the mediating role of debt financing costs and the moderating role of enterprise digital transformation in the mechanism of CSR on corporate innovation, this research conducts fixes effects models by collecting 27,912 data points from 3,775A-share China-listed enterprises, ranging in period from 2010 to 2020. Empirical research once again proves that the theories of innovation investment and dynamic capabilities effectively compensates for the shortcomings of reputation theory. These three theories effectively explain that what is the effect of CSR on enterprise innovation? How does CSR influence corporate innovation? And through what mechanisms can CSR better enhance corporate innovation? Findings: According to innovation investment theory, the cost of debt financing mediates the positive relationship between CSR and corporate innovation. This occurs because enterprises with robust CSR practices are more likely to secure external funding, thereby reducing their costs associated with external debt financing. Lower debt financing costs provide a stable source of funds for corporate innovation. Additionally, dynamic capability theory suggests that enterprise digital transformation moderates the positive relationship between CSR and corporate innovation. Building on these insights, it is recommended that enterprises, especially state-owned ones, should prioritize technological innovation to enhance their competitiveness. Research limitations/implications: This research aims to address and narrow the knowledge gap regarding the relation between CSR and corporate innovation through theoretical and empirical analyses. With respect to the influence mechanism, this research solely based on innovation investment theory and dynamic capabilities theory, focuses on the influence mechanism of CSR on corporate innovation, with the debt financing costs as the mediating variable and digital transformation as the moderating variable. However, the influence mechanism turns out to be complicated and there is room for further exploring numerous mechanisms. For example, future research can focus on identifying additional channels through which CSR exerts an influence on corporate innovation based on TOE theoretical framework. Practical implications: This research presents several strategies to enhance corporate innovation based on its conclusions: First, enterprises should promptly publish social responsibility reports to build a positive industry reputation. Moreover, by actively participating in CSR activities, they can strengthen their networks and enhance their industry standing. Second, the significant mediating role of debt financing costs should not be ignored. Enterprises are encouraged to seek diverse financing channels to reduce financial pressures, address financing challenges and facilitate the coordinated development of CSR and innovation. Third, enterprise digital transformation significantly affects the impact of CSR on innovation. Therefore, enterprises should advance digital transformation initiatives that incorporate technological innovation, organizational improvements and integration with supply chain partners. Finally, it has been noted that state-owned enterprises are often less responsive to technological innovation than their non-state counterparts. SOEs could redefine the scope and priorities of their social responsibilities to prevent excessive resource consumption that could hinder innovation. For instance, integrating some of their social responsibilities with innovation projects could promote both social and technological innovation objectives. Additionally, the government could ensure fair resource distribution among different types of enterprises and provide an equitable financing platform to mitigate financial challenges for both state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises. Originality/value: Reputation theory does not fully elucidate the mechanisms by which CSR influences corporate innovation or how to effectively enhance CSR’s positive impact on innovation. This research integrates the theories of innovation investment and dynamic capabilities to address these gaps. According to innovation investment theory, debt financing costs mediate the positive relationship between CSR and corporate innovation. Meanwhile, dynamic capabilities theory posits that enterprise digital transformation moderates this positive relationship, further strengthening the impact of CSR on innovation.","Corporate Innovation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Debt Financing Costs; Digital Transformation","","The authors acknowledge the support of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 22BGL054) and Beijing Social Science Foundation of China (No. 20GLC040).","Ang, Rui, The relationship between CSR and financial performance and the moderating effect of ownership structure: Evidence from Chinese heavily polluting listed enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 30, pp. 117-129, (2022); Bocquet, Rachel, Are firms with different CSR profiles equally innovative?

The results of this analysis offer answers to questions currently being discussed in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature, namely, on the effects of CSR communication on top talent attraction. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses structured interviews to analyze the communication perceptions and expectations of (n = 15) top talents when making employer decisions. It compares these with the expectations and intentions of HR managers responsible for programs and communications (n = 15). Findings: The study found that HR managers only partially reflect top talents’ specific communication expectations. In addition to the program-specific CSR content, corporate communications have an overarching optimization potential in the communication mode and information architecture. It is particularly striking that future executives proactively seek CSR content in hiring and access corporate and brand communications for this purpose. Research limitations: The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made a digital interview setting necessary and did not allow to react in detail on every physical signal. On top, the study has only 30 participants (15 HR/15 talents) from three different talent programs. Implications: The study identifies practical, gender-specific and industry-specific implications for corporate communications regarding content and mode of communication. Companies should specify concrete measures for recruiting future executives, but they can also indicate efforts and first initiatives, thus setting a more decisive stage for an aspiration. Originality/value: The study is characterized by its unique data set. Only a few companies have explicit programs for the development of future executives. The study also examines HR managers’ communication planning and expectations and future executives’ effective communication perceptions and perspectives.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Employer Branding; Recruiting; Talent","","","Annales Universitatis Apulensis Series Oeconomica, (2013); Aggarwal, Priyanka, Employee-level consequences of perceived internal and external CSR: decoding the moderation and mediation paths, Social Responsibility Journal, 19, 1, pp. 38-78, (2023); Ibt Journal of Business Studies, (2018); Corporate Strategy, (1965); Experiencing the New World of Work, (2025); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Aspers, Patrik, What is Qualitative in Qualitative Research, Qualitative Sociology, 42, 2, pp. 139-160, (2019); Barrick, Murray R., Selection for Fit, Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 6, pp. 171-193, (2019); Bhattacharya, C.

This study employs data from Chinese listed companies and adopts the entropy method to establish a set of green development indicators from eight aspects. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) model, we investigate the impact of blockchain applications on enterprise green development. The conclusions drawn are as follows: the application of blockchain technology significantly enhances the level of enterprise green development, a result supported by a series of robustness tests. The promotion of green development through blockchain applications is particularly pronounced among state-owned enterprises, large enterprises, and businesses in heavy-polluting industries. Further research reveals that blockchain application facilitates enterprise green development through three channels: cost savings, R&D improvement, and digital transformation.

It explores how these mechanisms contribute to the enhancement of these sustainability through knowledge management (KM) and innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This quantitative study examines the causal relationships among the key variables. A survey of 330 engineers from six O&G firms across three northern governorates in Iraq was conducted using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analysed through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling to validate the research model. Findings: The study highlights that knowledge is a fundamental resource for driving innovation and sustainable organisational practices. CoPs serve as a dynamic KM framework, facilitating efficient knowledge exchange, dissemination and application. This, in turn, enhances employees’ ability to address daily professional challenges while reinforcing social and environmental sustainability initiatives. The findings also reveal that CoPs and associated technologies significantly contribute to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of OS, demonstrating a moderate to substantial effect. Practical implications: The findings provide actionable insights for O&G companies aiming to integrate sustainability through technology-driven CoPs. By institutionalising CoPs and leveraging digital technologies, organisations can enhance collaborative learning, knowledge retention and sustainable innovation. This research also underscores the need for leaders and managers within O&G firms to prioritise technological advancements and knowledge-sharing strategies to drive social and environmental sustainability efforts. Social implications: The study highlights how technology-driven CoPs can foster knowledge-sharing, collaboration and social sustainability within organisations, particularly in the O&G sector. By leveraging digital platforms, virtual knowledge-sharing tools and AI-driven analytics, organisations can enhance workplace inclusivity, cross-disciplinary collaboration and employee engagement in sustainability initiatives. Furthermore, the adoption of CoPs and emerging digital technologies promotes a culture of collective learning and professional development, ensuring that employees at all levels contribute to and benefit from sustainable business practices. This research also underscores the role of technology-enhanced CoPs in bridging knowledge gaps, improving social equity in professional settings and strengthening corporate social responsibility efforts. Originality/value: While existing studies have demonstrated a link between KM and sustainable performance, this research uniquely examines CoPs and related technologies as enablers of social and environmental sustainability in the O&G sector. It provides a novel perspective on how organisations can leverage technological tools and knowledge-sharing platforms to enhance OS, bridging a critical gap in sustainability research.","Communities Of Practice; Information And Communication Technologies; Middle East; Oil And Gas; Organisational Sustainability; Structural Equation Modelling","","","Abbas, Jawad, Impact of total quality management on corporate sustainability through the mediating effect of knowledge management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 244, (2020); Abbas, Jawad, Impact of knowledge management practices on green innovation and corporate sustainable development: A structural analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 611-620, (2019); Abdulmuhsin, Amir A., How workplace bullying influences knowledge management processes: A developing country perspective, International Journal of Business and Systems Research, 15, 3, pp. 371-403, (2021); Abdulmuhsin, Amir A., Understanding the academic use of KM-driven Metaverse technology: insights from medical colleges, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, (2024); Abdulmuhsin, Amir A., The perception of COVID-19 and avoidance behavior in Turkey: the role of income level, gender and education, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 17, 10, pp. 2558-2583, (2022); Abdulmuhsin, Amir A., Guest editorial: Mass collaboration and knowledge management: reflections to achieve best practices, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, 30, 5, pp. 1041-1044, (2022); Asia Pacific Journal of Business Administration, (2025); Abed, Shaymaa Najm, The factors influencing the innovative performance of leaders in nurses’ professional: a developing country perspective, Leadership in Health Services, 35, 2, pp. 228-245, (2022); Day 4 Thu, (2020); Albort-Morant, Gema, The antecedents of green innovation performance: A model of learning and capabilities, Journal of Business Research, 69, 11, pp. 4912-4917, (2016)","","Emerald Publishing","2040803X; 20408021","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000563475"

This study aims to examine the intersection of CSR, more specifically corporate tax behavior, and corporations’ engagement with cryptocurrencies. Since Bitcoin’s emergence in 2008, these digital assets have disrupted traditional financial systems, prompting inquiries about their environmental impact and ethical implications for investors. This research aims to evaluate whether corporations involved in cryptocurrencies exhibit distinct tax behavior compared to those abstaining from these digital assets, with a particular focus on tax aggressiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes a sample of US-listed corporations that publicly associate themselves with cryptocurrencies, contrasting them with a similar group of corporations that do not. Using binary logistic regression, this study explores the relationship between corporate cryptocurrency engagement and tax aggressiveness, considering factors such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores and firm size. Findings: The findings indicate that corporations with higher ESG scores are less likely to participate in cryptocurrencies, suggesting a potential perception of these assets as less socially responsible. Surprisingly, less tax-aggressive corporations show a greater inclination toward cryptocurrency involvement, challenging the assumption that such engagement inherently correlates with irresponsible tax behavior. Originality/value: This research contributes to broader discussions on CSR, signaling theory and the evolving ethical and regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. By examining corporate tax behavior within the context of cryptocurrency participation, this study sheds light on the intricate dynamics at play in this emerging digital landscape.","Csr","","","Loss or Theft of Crypto Assets, (2023); Crypto Poses Significant Tax Problems and They could Get Worse, (2023); Balakrishnan, Karthik, Tax aggressiveness and corporate transparency, Accounting Review, 94, 1, pp. 45-69, (2019); Baudot, Lisa, Is Corporate Tax Aggressiveness a Reputation Threat?

Conceptually, it innovates by centering transparency reports as corporate social responsibility disclosures and by elaborating an argument that these voluntary disclosures are an emerging institutional practice that is shaped by isomorphic pressures. In contrast with the established analysis of other sectors of economic activity, sustained research on corporate social responsibility in the information and communications technology sector is underdeveloped. In addition to enriching the corporate social responsibility literature on digital intermediaries, this study makes a two-fold theoretical contribution to platform governance literature. First, it offers empirical data to support an emerging industry norm diffused among firms across jurisdictions. Second, it offers an explanatory rationale for both Big Tech and small and midsize enterprises (SMEs). For market leaders, who are under increased scrutiny as “new governors” in the online environment, transparency reports are issued as legitimacy-seeking strategic communications. For SMEs–animated by mimetic isomorphism–transparency reports are issued to imitate market leaders and virtue signal.","Big Tech; Content Analysis; Csr Disclosures; Digital Intermediaries; Governance; Legitimacy; Smes; Transparency","","","Transparency Reporting Index Access Nows Global Database, (2021); Al Fadli, Amer, The influence of ownership structure on the extent of CSR reporting: An emerging market study, Business and Society Review, 127, 3, pp. 725-754, (2022); Albu, Oana Brindusa, Organizational Transparency: Conceptualizations, Conditions, and Consequences, Business and Society, 58, 2, pp. 268-297, (2019); Ananny, Mike, Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability, New Media and Society, 20, 3, pp. 973-989, (2018); Balkin, Jack M., Digital speech and democratic culture: A theory of freedom of expression for the information society, New York University Law Review, 79, 1, pp. 1-58, (2004); Ballard, Ben, Mixed traditions: evaluating telecommunications transparency, Internet Policy Review, 11, 1, (2022); Bauman, Zygmunt, After Snowden: Rethinking the impact of surveillance, International Political Sociology, 8, 2, pp. 121-144, (2014); More State Content Moderation Laws Coming to Social Media Platforms, (2022); SMU Law Review, (2025); Brammer, Steve J., The development of corporate charitable contributions in the UK: A stakeholder analysis, Journal of Management Studies, 41, 8, pp. 1411-1434, (2004)","","Routledge","01972243; 10876537","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000430218"

Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative study reports on a Swedish food supply network, consisting of interviews with retailers/restaurants, wholesalers, and farmers/processors. By applying the analytical lens of responsibilisation, the abductive study reveals the complexities and barriers in transitioning to a sustainable food industry with the help of digital tools. Findings: The findings demonstrate that perceived responsibility for corporate sustainability was limited to the national legislative framework. This limitation is evidence of an evaded regime of responsibilisation across supply chain actors. Additionally, the use of digital tools to support sustainability information sharing was largely absent in strategic orientations. This selective or withheld sustainability information translated into a gatekeeping mechanism that potentially hinders collective efforts to achieve sustainability. Practical implications: The findings indicate that Swedish food actors are currently in a waiting position regarding the use of digital tools to promote sustainability information sharing. More specifically, industry actors perceive the need for an updated regulatory sustainability framework that supports a faster, digitally supported transition towards a sustainable food industry. Policymakers should be more proactive to incentivise industry actors to develop and adopt digital tools promoting corporate sustainability. Originality/value: Responding to the call for more research into the empirical reality of supply chain actors and their approaches towards digitalisation and sustainability, this study bridges the gap between conceptual studies and practice. Furthermore, this study refines the theory of responsibilisation by shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of sharing sustainability information within a food supply network. It suggests that there exists an evaded regime of responsibilisation whereby governmental agencies are assigned the greatest responsibility to drive corporate sustainability, and, in the absence of such regulatory requirements, the sharing of sustainability information is limited.","Corporate Sustainability; Food Supply Chain; Responsibilisation; Retailing; Sustainability Information","","Funding statement: This research was funded by the Swedish research council for sustainable development Formas [Award number: 2019\u201302274]","Allabolag Urban Deli Bolagsoversikt, (2023); Allenbacher, Janine, How assessment and cooperation practices influence suppliers’ adoption of sustainable supply chain practices: An inter-organizational learning perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 403, (2023); Philosophical Quarterly, (2012); Andersen, Allan Dahl, On digitalization and sustainability transitions, Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 41, pp. 96-98, (2021); Axfood in Brief, (2023); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Evolving sustainably: A longitudinal study of corporate sustainable development, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 3, pp. 197-218, (2005); Barrientos, Stephanie Ware, Labour Chains': Analysing the Role of Labour Contractors in Global Production Networks, Journal of Development Studies, 49, 8, pp. 1058-1071, (2013); Bastl, Marko, Buyer-supplier relationships in a servitized environment: An examination with Cannon and Perreault's framework, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 32, 6, pp. 650-675, (2012); Basu, Kunal, Corporate social responsibility: A process model of sensemaking, Academy of Management Review, 33, 1, pp. 122-136, (2008); Beulens, Adrie J.M., Food safety and transparency in food chains and networks.

Examining how digital transformation motivates firms to innovate in green management practices sustainably is essential. Utilizing a dataset encompassing Chinese A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2020, this study empirically examines digital transformation's effects on the ongoing quest for green innovation. Additionally, it delves into the mediating role that green management innovation plays in this dynamic and evaluates how the fit of the innovation ecosystem within a company's regional environment serves as a moderating factor. The findings indicate that digital transformation strengthens firms' capacities for persistent green innovation. Green management innovation is revealed to be an intermediary in this process; meanwhile, aligning the innovation ecosystem's niche within a company's region amplifies the influence of digital transformation on fostering sustainable green innovation. This research offers valuable theoretical perspectives for organizations that leverage digital transformation as a strategic asset for ecologically friendly manufacturing and long-term expansion. This research examines how digital transformation drives sustainable green innovation in businesses, a significant but less-studied area. We aim to uncover the mechanisms influencing innovation, emphasizing the impact of green management and the fit of the innovation environment. We strive to provide empirical insights that enhance theoretical knowledge at the junction of digital strategy and environmental responsibility, guiding corporate practices toward operational efficiency and ecological sustainability.

Although the financial drivers behind FinTech investments have been extensively explored, there remains a gap in the extant research regarding the influence of governance factors on these kinds of investments. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating whether and how governance composition and characteristics are associated with investments in FinTech projects, exploring a sample of Cooperative Credit Banks (CCBs) operating in Italy, a unique context where these small institutions represent more than half of the banking sector and that often face difficulties in adopting innovative and digital tools. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a quantitative approach. Specifically, multiple regressions analyses were performed on a sample of 230 Italian CCBs during the period 2017–2022.

Based on optimal distinctiveness theory, we explore how enterprises balance the tension between political strategy and competitive strategy from the perspective of corporate digital responsibility to achieve optimal firm performance. Observing data such as annual reports, patent application information, and operating conditions of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021 reveals the impact of corporate digital responsibility, substantive and symbolic digital technology on firm performance. The research results show that substantive digital technology innovation is superior to symbolic digital technology innovation in promoting firm performance. Mechanism analysis shows that symbolic digital technology innovation satisfies the firm's political strategy and positively impacts firm performance through management empowerment. In contrast, substantive digital technology innovation satisfies the firm's competitive strategy and improves performance by empowering the workforce. Further analysis find that corporate digital responsibility positively moderates the impact of substantive digital technology innovation on corporate performance and negatively moderates the relationship between symbolic digital technology innovation and corporate performance.

The findings indicate that non-main board companies achieve greater enhancements in economic competitiveness and social responsibility, whereas main board companies see more improvements in internal governance. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) gain more from digital initiatives compared to non-SOEs. Additionally, the study employs the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to demonstrate that higher market concentration reduces the economic benefits of digital transformation but enhances its non-economic advantages.

While companies may face cost pressures that drive them to engage in increased tax avoidance, they may also suppress tax avoidance due to considering social responsibility. This study explores the impact of the carbon emission trading system (ETS) on corporate tax avoidance behavior. Research Findings/Insights: We find that tax avoidance activities are suppressed after companies participate in ETS. ETS curbs corporate tax avoidance by enhancing corporate social responsibility and strengthening regulatory deterrence. This effect is more pronounced in firms located in more economically developed regions, those with stronger tax enforcement, and companies undergoing digital transformation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study enriches research on the economic consequences of ETS and the factors influencing corporate tax avoidance, expanding the relationship between tax policies and environmental governance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides government implications in further improving ETS policies to enhance positive spillover effects on taxation and to refine corporate carbon disclosure systems. It also provides guidance for companies to promote tax sustainability by actively participating in ETS and leveraging digital transformation strategies.

Specifically, it assesses the interaction between organizational sustainability, knowledge sharing and corporate social responsibility as essential factors in enhancing digital innovation in high-tech enterprises. The role of corporate governance is examined to engage organizational social structures and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The research empirically evaluates the adaptation processes of organizational social networks (OSNs) and corporate collaboration to drive digital innovation. By integrating perspectives from social exchange theory and social cognition theory, a comprehensive model is developed to understand the influence of corporate social networks and collaborative creativity within enterprises. Hierarchical regression analysis is conducted on a sample of high-tech companies located in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Findings: The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between robust OSNs and enhanced collaborative innovation in business environments. Notably, the connection between OSNs and corporate collaborative creativity is partially mediated by the dissemination of information and expertise within the networks. Additionally, the integration of DC tools enhances both OSNs and collaborative innovation. This underscores the need for strategic investments in nurturing corporate social networks and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing among employees. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the nexus among OSNs, Knowledge Sharing and Digital Innovation in high-tech enterprises, contributing valuable insights through the lens of social exchange and social cognition theories.","Collaborative Creativity; Corporate Social Networks; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Infrastructure; Knowledge Dissemination; Knowledge Sharing; Social Structures","","This research was conducted with the support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation and Ural Federal University, Yekaterinburg, Russia within the framework of the Priority-2030 Program.

Specifically, it explores Tencent’s organizational restructuring, including the establishment of the sustainable social value (SSV) division, as well as the accompanying corporate practices and discursive strategies aimed at enhancing its legitimacy. As an exemplar of the “institutional chameleon,” Tencent has deftly navigated regulatory waters through organizational metamorphosis. However, while Tencent’s enhanced CSR initiatives have certainly yielded some social benefits, the SSV initiatives are increasingly emerging as a new business frontier for the company, leveraging its vast infrastructural capacities to capitalize on the very social fabric it purports to support.

First, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted to conceptualize consumer-centric CDR and formulate the underlying constructs and measures. This was followed by a quantitative study to confirm the validity and reliability of the qualitative results. The scale development and validation process resulted in a measure consisting of six dimensions: digital transparency, digital privacy, digital quality, digital remedy, digital accessibility, and digital inclusiveness.

However, while digitalization creates opportunities to adopt environmental practices and deploying sustainable strategies, it also introduces complexities and challenges. This study examines the information-centered drivers of digitalization that push enterprises toward sustainable practices, such as technological advancements and the increased demand for transparency, while identifying challenges, including integration costs, technological readiness, and managerial hesitation. Using a multidimensional framework that combines capabilities, environmental practices, and motivations, we provide insights into how technology can both support and challenge sustainability efforts in industry. Our aim is to introduce a methodology to guide the development of strategies for facilitating environmental transitions of enterprises. Within the context of informational capabilities, this scoping review identifies two environmental archetypes—spontaneity and planning—that represent common workforce mindsets toward sustainability. It also classifies universal practices and motivations, with associations being validated through a focus group of members from a French industrial consortium, which also facilitates understanding how digitalized capabilities impact environmental actions and behavioral dynamics. The key findings reveal that while digital communication capabilities significantly enhance the return on investment for environmental practices, barriers remain, such as insufficient alignment of digital tools with sustainable outcomes and variable technology access across industries. The results also underscore the role of product-data and sensor-based analytics in reducing environmental impacts, inviting a further exploration of digitalization’s role in sustainability within the frameworks of behavioral and organizational theories.","Industry; Information; Methodology; Strategy; Sustainability; Transition; Advanced Technology; Corporate Social Responsibility; Decision Making; Digitization; Environmental Impact Assessment; Industrial Investment; Information Technology; Planning Method; Sustainability; France","advanced technology; corporate social responsibility; decision making; digitization; environmental impact assessment; industrial investment; information technology; planning method; sustainability; France","This work was funded by the Accel 4.0 project, as part of the Chair Transformation 4.0 between UIMM de l\u2019Ain and Grenoble INP Graduate schools of Engineering and Management, Universit\u00E9 Grenoble Alpes.","Shi, Yunfei, Exploration–Exploitation: How business analytics powers organisational ambidexterity for environmental sustainability, Information Systems Journal, 34, 3, pp. 894-930, (2024); Cheng, Hongwei, How firms select environmental behaviours in China: The framework of environmental motivations and performance, Journal of Cleaner Production, 208, pp. 132-141, (2019); Annunziata, Eleonora, The role of organizational capabilities in attaining corporate sustainability practices and economic performance: Evidence from Italian wine industry, Journal of Cleaner Production, 171, pp. 1300-1311, (2018); González-Benito, Javier, A study of the motivations for the environmental transformation of companies, Industrial Marketing Management, 34, 5, pp. 462-475, (2005); Analisis Comparativo De Las Necesidades Ambientales De Las Pyme En Chile Colombia Y Mexico, (2003); Cassells, Sue M., Managing to be environmentally responsible: incentives and disincentives reported by small businesses, Small Enterprise Research, 26, 1, pp. 1-17, (2019); Naveed, Wishal, Circular Economy and Information Technologies: Identifying and Ranking the Factors of Successful Practices, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 23, (2022); Đalić, Nataša, Modeling the influence of information systems on sustainable business performance and competitiveness, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 17, (2021); Lei, Chun Fong, Green IT/IS adoption and environmental performance: The synergistic roles of IT–business strategic alignment and environmental motivation, Information and Management, 60, 8, (2023); Richardson, Benjamin J., Keeping ethical investment ethical: Regulatory issues for investing for sustainability, Journal of Business Ethics, 87, 4, pp. 555-572, (2009)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215779121"

These enterprises have significant social responsibilities when handling issues such as algorithmic discrimination, user data breaches, and market monopolies. Herein, we adopt the grounded theory method, selecting three unique types of PEs as research subjects. Through in-depth interviews with stakeholders and a three-level coding analysis, we build a “triple” responsibility model of PEs’ digital responsibility (DR). This model is based on the PEs’ triple organizational identity and is framed by three dimensions: product responsibility, technological responsibility, and application responsibility. The model also summarizes three dimensions and contents of responsibility: digital self-regulation, the digital regulation of others, and digital foresight. The concept of PEs’ DR is clarified and the structure and dimensions of PEs’ DR are delineated. This study holds significant theoretical and practical value for perfecting the social responsibility system in the platform economy. The triple DR model fills the research gap on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate DR and overcomes the limitations of the traditional CSR paradigm, providing a theoretical foundation for PEs’ sustainable development in the digital era.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility; Organizational Identity; Platform Enterprise; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Conditions; Industrial Enterprise; Market Conditions; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainable Development","corporate social responsibility; economic conditions; industrial enterprise; market conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development","Zhejiang Province Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project \u201CResearch on the Deficiency and Governance of Information Responsibility in the Platform Economy Perspective\u2014Based on the Multidimensional Matching Effect of Multiple Identities of Platform Element Subjects\u201D (Project Number: 23NDJC352YB).","Bonsón, Enrique, Disclosures about algorithmic decision making in the corporate reports of Western European companies, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 48, (2023); Account Mon, (2023); Bandara, Ruwan J., Addressing privacy predicaments in the digital marketplace: A power-relations perspective, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 44, 5, pp. 423-434, (2020); Binns, Reuben, Algorithmic Accountability and Public Reason, Philosophy and Technology, 31, 4, pp. 543-556, (2018); Journal of Management World, (2022); Mihale-Wilson, Cristina A., Corporate Digital Responsibility: Relevance and Opportunities for Business and Information Systems Engineering, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 64, 2, pp. 127-132, (2022); Digital Labour the Prosumer and Play, (2019); Econ Manag, (2023); Csr 2 0 Transforming Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility, (2014); Tsinghua Manag Rev, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215774183"

However, the adoption of digital technologies mitigates these adverse effects by enhancing transparency and reducing the likelihood of opportunistic behavior. Theoretically, this research contributes to the understanding of how digitalization can reinforce corporate governance and sustainability in uncertain times.

Yet whether and how digital resources shape corporate social responsibility (CSR) remains unclear. This paper examines the relationship between digital resources, CSR, and environmental performance during a period of rapid technological development, with a focus on Chinese manufacturing enterprises. We draw on structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify how digitalization contributes to more environmentally friendly and sustainable economic development. Our dataset comprises survey data from 174 Chinese manufacturing companies, providing a theoretical basis and empirical support for the deep integration of digitalization with green and low-carbon transformation. The results demonstrate that digital resources significantly promote CSR, which in turn facilitates the improvement of environmental performance. We thus find that CSR plays a mediating role in the digital resources–environmental performance relationship. Consequently, companies can consider greening their innovations through CSR practices as part of the digital transformation environment. Finally, digital resources and CSR contribute to greening innovation in different ways. This study highlights the critical role of robust CSR in driving green performance during digital transformation. It addresses a significant research gap by exploring the synergistic relationship between digitalization and green innovation, emphasizing the strategic importance of integrating CSR to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes for both society and businesses. Additionally, the study identifies deficiencies in existing research regarding the interplay between digital transformation and CSR and investigates how enterprises can directly enhance environmental performance by leveraging digital resources within the context of the digital economy.","China; Csr; Digital Capabilities; Digital Transformation; Environmental Performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Data Set; Greenspace; Industrial Policy; Innovation; Transformation; China","corporate social responsibility; data set; greenspace; industrial policy; innovation; transformation; China","We appreciate the financial support provided by the General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Jiangsu Universities in 2022, China (No. 2022SJYB2321).

While the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) has improved the delivery of CIS, there are persistent usability challenges, especially among smallholder farmers. This study examined the usability of new ICTs in delivering CIS for farming in Ada East District, Ghana. The research addressed the question, how do smallholder farmers respond to CIS delivered through new ICTs, and what are the usability challenges of these technologies. Using data from document reviews, interviews, and focus group discussions, findings show that farmers predominantly rely on local or indigenous knowledge and traditional ICTs like radio and television for CIS, 7 New ICTs including: Website on weather information, Bulletin on social media: Facebook, WhatsApp weather forecast presented as a flyer, YouTube video on weather information, Short message service (SMS), Audio WhatsApp weather forecast and Weather apps were identified, providing daily, weekly and seasonal forecasts outlooks. However, the utilisation of these new ICTs is relatively limited. Only a few farmers were aware of the delivery of CIS through these new ICTs. Farmers with smartphones are mainly those who access daily and seasonal forecast outlooks using new ICTs, while face-to-face interactions remain the common mode for disseminating information among farmers. Although new ICTs offer forecasts, usability is influenced by the relevance and comprehension of the content, location success and time, typography, symbols and graphics, language clarity, feedback and interactivity and ability to use the new ICT tools. The findings of the study have implications for CIS developers and providers to incorporate design principles such as revision of text structure, font style and size, symbols, wording pattern and word counts. It shed light on the evolving landscape of CIS delivery in farming communities, where traditional methods coexist with emerging digital platforms and provided knowledge on the need to raise awareness on the use of new ICTs with CIS among farmers. Practical Implications of the research for policy makers and practitioners: The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Climate Information Services (CIS) offers a transformative approach to agricultural decision-making for farmers. This research identifies various new ICT platforms including Websites, Bulletin on social media: Facebook, WhatsApp weather forecast presented as a flyer, YouTube video on weather information, Short message service (SMS, Audio WhatsApp weather forecast and Weather apps, as key tools for delivering weather and climate forecasts to farmers. The findings have crucial implications for policymakers, businesses, and agricultural extension services, emphasising the role of ICTs in enhancing access to vital climate information for improved farming practices. Implications for Policy Makers: Policymakers should work towards standardising content and delivery methods of CIS across various ICT platforms to ensure consistency and reliability. This includes setting guidelines for accuracy, clarity, and comprehensibility of weather information. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks should be established to monitor and evaluate the performance of new ICT-based CIS providers, ensuring they meet the required standards and addressing issues of misinformation. Policies should encourage the development of user-friendly ICT platforms that cater to the diverse needs of farmers. This involves promoting the design of intuitive interfaces that are easy to navigate and available in local languages. Policy support for user-centred design can enhance the effectiveness of ICT-based CIS by making them more accessible and practical for end-users. Enabling feedback mechanisms within new ICT-based CIS can enhance their relevance and usability. Policy initiatives should support integrating interactive features in CIS platforms that allow farmers to provide feedback, ask questions, and seek clarifications. This could involve the development of mobile apps or platforms where farmers can communicate directly with meteorologists or agricultural experts. The varied use of platforms such as websites, social media, and mobile apps allows for tailored dissemination of CIS to different segments of the farming population. Policy interventions should ensure equitable access to these technologies across all regions, especially targeting under-served and rural areas. This could involve subsidising data costs or providing ICT training to farmers to bridge the digital divide. Investment in ICT infrastructure is essential to support the effective delivery of CIS. This includes enhancing internet connectivity in rural areas, promoting the adoption of smartphones, and improving mobile network coverage. Such infrastructural developments will facilitate farmers’ access to real-time weather updates and ensure the sustainability of new ICT-based CIS. Implications for Businesses: The emergence of new ICT-based CIS presents significant business opportunities for ICT, telecommunications, and software development companies. Businesses can innovate by developing and marketing new applications, platforms, and services tailored to the needs of farmers. For instance, creating localised weather apps or integrating CIS with agricultural management systems can provide value-added services to the farming community. Businesses can explore partnerships with CIS providers to sponsor or subsidise the delivery of weather information services to farmers. This can enhance brand visibility and corporate social responsibility (CSR) while supporting the agricultural sector. For instance, telecommunications companies can offer discounted data plans for accessing CIS or collaborate with the Ghana Meteorological Agency to disseminate free weather updates via short message service (SMS). The adoption of new ICTs in agriculture opens up new markets for businesses. Companies can target rural and farming communities with customised products and services such as affordable smartphones, data plans, or specialised apps for agricultural purposes. Market research and segmentation strategies can help businesses identify and cater to the specific needs of different farming segments. Implications for Agricultural Extension Services: Agricultural extension services should focus on training and capacity building to help farmers effectively use new ICTs to access CIS. This includes training sessions, workshops, and tutorials on using smartphones, navigating websites, subscribing to SMS services, and understanding weather forecasts. Building farmers’ digital literacy is crucial for maximising the benefits of ICT-based CIS. Agricultural extension services can modernise their practices by integrating new ICT-based CIS into their outreach programs. Extension agents can use mobile apps, social media, and other digital platforms to disseminate weather information, offer real-time advice, and engage with farmers more effectively. This approach can enhance the reach and impact of extension services, making them more responsive to the needs of farmers. To enhance the usability of CIS, agricultural extension services should ensure that weather information is localised and presented in a context relevant to farmers. This involves translating weather updates into local languages, using culturally appropriate symbols, and providing practical advice that farmers can apply directly to their agricultural activities. Agriculture extension services can facilitate the formation of community networks or groups that share weather information and CIS updates via ICT platforms like WhatsApp or Facebook. These networks can serve as support systems where farmers exchange information, share experiences, and discuss the implications of weather forecasts on their farming practices. Establishing a feedback loop is essential for the continuous improvement of new ICT-based CIS. Extension agents can collect feedback from farmers on the usability, accuracy, and relevance of the information provided through various ICT platforms. This feedback can be used to refine and enhance CIS, ensuring that it meets the evolving needs of the farming community. Conclusion: By recognising and addressing the unique challenges and opportunities presented in our research findings, stakeholders can enhance the accessibility, usability, and impact of weather information on farming practices. Together, these efforts can contribute to a more resilient and informed agricultural sector that is better equipped to navigate the complexities of climate variability and change.","Climate Information Services; Farming; Ghana; Ict; Usability; Agricultural Technology; Farmers Knowledge; Indigenous Knowledge; Information And Communication Technology; Smallholder; Social Media; Technology Adoption; Weather Forecasting; Ghana","agricultural technology; farmers knowledge; indigenous knowledge; information and communication technology; smallholder; social media; technology adoption; weather forecasting; Ghana","This research is funded by the DAAD Climap Africa Postdoctoral fellowship programs.

Based on patents' information, we classify DTI into symbolic DTI and substantive DTI. Specifically, symbolic DTI is the innovation driven by firms' legitimacy strategy, while substantive DTI is the type of innovation that helps strengthen firms’ competitive advantages. Using a sample of Chinese A-share-listed firms from 2009 to 2020, we use polynomial regression and response surface analysis to examine how firms balance the tension between competitiveness and legitimacy through digital technological innovations in order to achieve optimal corporate ESG performance. We find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between symbolic DTI and corporate ESG performance. Meanwhile, there is a simple positive correlation between substantive DTI and corporate ESG performance. Moreover, the incongruence between the two types of DTI significantly hurts corporate ESG performance and is mainly concentrated in firms with high symbolic-low substantive DTI strategy. Further analyses show that corporate managerial myopia positively (negatively) affects the relationship between symbolic (substantive) DTI and ESG performance. Our paper expands the literature on the relationship between DTI and firms' ESG performance. It provides managerial insights for the Chinese government to encourage digital economy development and promotes firms' substantive DTI to enhance their ESG performance.","Competitive Strategy; Esg Performance; Legitimacy Strategy; Optimal Distinctiveness; Substantive Dti; Symbolic Dti; Competitive Strategy; Digital Technologies; Esg Performance; Legitimacy Strategy; Optimal Distinctiveness; Performance; Substantive Digital Technology Innovation; Symbolic Digital Technology Innovation; Technology Innovation; Competitiveness; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Development; Industrial Enterprise; Industrial Performance; Innovation; Technological Development; Article; Digital Technology; Human; Polynomial Regression Analysis; Structural Equation Modeling; Surface Analysis; China; Commercial Phenomena; Invention; Trust; Commerce; Digital Technology; Inventions; Trust","Competitive strategy; Digital technologies; ESG performance; Legitimacy strategy; Optimal distinctiveness; Performance; Substantive digital technology innovation; Symbolic digital technology innovation; Technology innovation; competitiveness; corporate social responsibility; economic development; industrial enterprise; industrial performance; innovation; technological development; Article; digital technology; human; polynomial regression analysis; structural equation modeling; surface analysis; China; commercial phenomena; invention; trust; Commerce; Digital Technology; Inventions; Trust","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China, under Grants No.23AZD056.; Funding text 2: However, not all digital technological innovation behaviors can positively affect corporate ESG ratings. Specifically, this paper argues that moderate symbolic digital technological innovations can increase information transparency, gain legitimacy, and improve ESG ratings. However, excessive symbolic digital technology innovation may weaken the credibility of information, thus negatively affecting ESG ratings, i.e., there is an \u201Cinverted U\u201D relationship between symbolic digital technology innovation and ESG ratings. In addition, this paper also argues that the successful implementation of digital innovations that represent substantive digital technology has a positive impact on firms' ESG ratings. Therefore, this paper explores the impact of substantive and symbolic DTI on firms' ESG ratings, not only to provide theoretical and empirical support for exploring the theoretical mechanisms of the impact of digital technological innovation on firms' ESG ratings but also to explore the impact of the consistency and inconsistency between symbolic and substantive DTI on firms' ESG ratings from the perspective of firms' motivation for digital technological innovations in order to provide insights on how firms can formulate optimal digital technological innovation strategies.Negative effect of legitimacy prioritization strategy. First, suppose a firm undertakes a relatively large number of symbolic DTI actions to gain public recognition but needs to undertake more substantive DTI actions. In that case, this kind of incoherent DTI behavior is often referred to as \u201Cgreenwashing\u201D or \u201Cdecoupling\u201D. If detected, decoupled behavior can lead stakeholders to question the firm's credibility (Fiss and Zajac, 2006), withdrawing their support and loyalty, thereby reducing its legitimacy and, ultimately, social performance (Gull et al., 2023). Second, if a company draws on a relatively large number of symbolic DTI external actions to gain public support but does not make sufficient structural changes (Substantive DTI), it is more likely to be perceived as adopting a \u201Ctalk\u201D strategy (Schons and Steinmeier, 2016; Verk et al., 2021). The lack of a high level of substantive DTI will lead to a loss of competitiveness and a market for sustainable development, which will not be conducive to increased productivity, scale-up, and long-term economic profitability and ultimately will hurt firms' social performance.This work was supported by the Key Projects of The National Social Science Found of China, under Grants No. 23AZD056.","Aben, Tom A.E., Managing information asymmetry in public–private relationships undergoing a digital transformation: the role of contractual and relational governance, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 41, 7, pp. 1145-1191, (2021); Acemoglu, Daron, The race between man and machine: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment, American Economic Review, 108, 6, pp. 1488-1542, (2018); Review of Economics and Statistics, (2022); Benaim, Mickaël, From symbolic values to symbolic innovation: Internet-memes and innovation, Research Policy, 47, 5, pp. 901-910, (2018); Bharadwaj, Anandhi S., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Bresciani, Stefano, Digital transformation as a springboard for product, process and business model innovation, Journal of Business Research, 128, pp. 204-210, (2021); Brynjolfsson, Erik, The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies†, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 13, 1, pp. 333-372, (2021); Management Review, (2021); Darnall, Nicole M., Do ESG reporting guidelines and verifications enhance firms' information disclosure?, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1214-1230, (2022); Dhir, Amandeep, Drivers of sustainable business model innovations.

The results indicate that CSR engagement significantly improves after DT, primarily affecting shareholder and social responsibility. Internal dynamics, such as decreased information asymmetry and irrational decision-making, and external pressures to gain media and analyst attention, are critical pathways through which DT promotes CSR engagement. The promotion of CSR engagement through DT is influenced by both corporate-level factors (pre-information base and internal control quality) and regional-level factors (digital economic environment and government regulation intensity). Additionally, investors can effectively identify DT to enhance CSR engagement, leading to a positive market response. This study provides new empirical insights for firms seeking to promote digital technology in stakeholder management and internal governance and has significant theoretical and practical implications for CSR engagement in the digital era.","Corporate Social Responsibility Engagement; Digital Transformation; Integration Of Informatization And Industrialization","","We thank Samuel A.

This paper constructs a theoretical model to explain the impact of digital transformation on inconsistent CSR. Based on the panel data of 1695 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this article identifies the direct impact, underlying mechanism, and heterogeneous impact of digital transformation on inconsistent CSR. The results indicate that digital transformation decreases inconsistent CSR. The mechanism analysis shows that digital transformation reduces inconsistent CSR by increasing the attention to internal stakeholders and the attention to internal and external stakeholders. Further tests of the moderating effect reveal that media coverage mitigates the impact of digital transformation on the attention to internal stakeholders. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that the impact of digital transformation is more pronounced in firms with Party organizations. This article contributes new empirical evidence regarding CSR-enhancing effects of digital transformation and extends practical implications for firms to better balance internal and external CSR so that employees can share in corporate growth.

Anchored in Voluntary Disclosure Theory and Customer Engagement Theory, this study builds and tests a conceptual model focusing on digital CSR disclosure and its impact on customer trust and engagement. Using a sample of 675 British consumers, we show that a firm's digital disclosure of CSR issues pertaining to employee welfare, consumer protection, eco-friendly practices, and community involvement positively affects consumer trust. Trust was subsequently found to have a favorable impact on customer engagement. Finally, the association between each of the four dimensions of digital CSR disclosure and consumer trust was revealed to be stronger in the case of consumers characterized by high levels of deontology and law obedience.","Csr; Customer Engagement; Deontology; Digital; Disclosure; Law Obedience; Trust","","","European Journal of Business and Management, (2014); Ahmad, Wasim, Determinants of CSR and green purchase intention: Mediating role of customer green psychology during COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Cleaner Production, 389, (2023); Journal of Customer Behaviour, (2019); Al Omoush, Khaled Saleh, The impact of digital corporate social responsibility on social entrepreneurship and organizational resilience, Management Decision, 62, 8, pp. 2621-2640, (2024); Allee, Kristian D., the structure of voluntary disclosure narratives: Evidence from tone dispersion, Journal of Accounting Research, 53, 2, pp. 241-274, (2015); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Agirre-Aramburu, Izaskun, The Effects of Corporate Social Responsibility on Customer Loyalty: The Mediating Effect of Reputation in Cooperative Banks Versus Commercial Banks in the Basque Country, Journal of Business Ethics, 154, 3, pp. 701-719, (2019); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Bagozzi, Richard P., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Blut, Markus, Effectiveness of engagement initiatives across engagement platforms: A meta-analysis, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 51, 5, pp. 941-965, (2023)","","Elsevier Inc.","01482963","","JBRED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207729414"

Nevertheless, a clear understanding of this phenomenon is key to developing rigorous and meaningful knowledge and enabling future research. Our critical review analyses 91 articles on digital transformation and sustainability research to address this issue. The findings propose a synthesis of the definition types of digital transformation and sustainability in four categories, from which only 16 articles show a relationship between both concepts. This study theoretically contributes to management research by uncovering issues and assumptions around the conceptualizations of digital transformation and sustainability at the corporate level. By doing so, we present a consolidation of conceived knowledge and clarify these interrelated concepts.

The results show a positive correlation between digital transformation and firm innovation performance. In addition, the study identifies a significant mediating effect of research and development (R&D) investment intensity, suggesting that increased R&D investment enhances the benefits of digital transformation. However, it also finds that CSR implementation negatively moderates this relationship, suggesting that an excessive focus on CSR can be economically burdensome and potentially detrimental to innovation efforts.

Using A-share listed firms from 2013 to 2022 as the research sample, the paper empirically examines the impact of digital transformation on corporate green innovation from an affordance perspective. The findings suggest that the higher the level of digital transformation, backed by accumulative and variational affordances, in a firm, the more conducive it is to corporate green innovation as it enables the homogenization, recombination, and transformation of existing information related to green environmental protection and low-carbon energy efficiency, facilitating firms to achieve targeted and breakthrough green innovations. The analysis of the moderating effects of public environmental concern, economic policy uncertainty, and regional innovation readiness suggested that public environmental concern and regional innovation readiness positively moderate the relationship between digital transformation and corporate green innovation, while economic policy uncertainty perception negatively moderates this relationship. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that digital transformation positively affects corporate green innovation within labor-intensive firms and state-owned enterprises. The study contributes to the literature by enhancing our understanding of the affordance theory in the domain of digital transformation. By investigating the key organizational and institutional affordances – economic policy uncertainty perception, public environmental concern, and regional innovation readiness – the research provides valuable insight to policymakers in fostering green innovation.","Affordance Theory; Digital Transformation; Economic Policy Uncertainty Perception; Green Innovation; Public Environmental Concern; Regional Innovation Readiness; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Policy; Innovation; Institutional Framework; Perception; State Owned Enterprise; Technological Development; Uncertainty Analysis","corporate social responsibility; economic policy; innovation; institutional framework; perception; state owned enterprise; technological development; uncertainty analysis","This research work was funded by Institutional Fund Projects under grant no.

We find that green credit policies alleviate heavily polluting enterprises’ maturity mismatch between investment and financing by inhibiting overinvestment. In addition, we find that the effect of green credit policies on the maturity mismatch between investment and financing is more significant for the enterprises in the cities with higher digital financial inclusion, higher corporate social responsibility, and higher green innovation.

Data shows that group authorships are on the rise but thus far, in scholarly discussions about authorship, they have not gained much specific attention. Group authorship can minimize tensions within the group about authorship order and the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion of individual authors. However, current use of group authorships has drawbacks, such as ethical challenges associated with the attribution of credit and responsibilities, legal challenges regarding how copyrights are handled, and technical challenges related to the lack of persistent identifiers (PIDs), such as ORCID, for groups. We offer two recommendations: 1) Journals should develop and share context-specific and unambiguous guidelines for group authorship, for which they can use the four baseline requirements offered in this paper; 2) Using persistent identifiers for groups and consistent reporting of members’ contributions should be facilitated through devising PIDs for groups and linking these to the ORCIDs of their individual contributors and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the published item.","Authorship; Ethics; Group Processes; Publishing; Reward; Ethics; Human; Publication; Publishing; Research Ethics; Writing; Authorship; Copyright; Editorial Policies; Ethics, Research; Humans; Periodicals As Topic; Publishing","ethics; human; publication; publishing; research ethics; writing; Authorship; Copyright; Editorial Policies; Ethics, Research; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing","This work was supported, in part, by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences UL1TR001422 (KH, MH) and the National Library of Medicine\u2019s Network of the National Library of Medicine U24LM013751 (KH, MH).

Social media is one technology at the forefront of research into sustainability due to its social nature and ability to monitor human behaviour. Social media has become an integral part of society with a far-reaching impact that extends beyond our personal lives. Since its inception in the early 2000s, social media has grown exponentially and transformed in the variety of platforms available, usage and influence. It has become a powerful tool for sharing information, influencing behaviours and opinions and starting global movements. In this regard, these platforms are essential in shaping our understanding and actions around sustainability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on both the positive and negative impact of social media on sustainability and how exactly social media influences sustainability. This systematic literature review (SLR) paper aims to explore the impact of social media on social and environmental dimensions of sustainability, examining both the negative and positive implications of its pervasive use. The SLR assessed 70 studies using the Web of Science and Science Direct databases. The results of this study show the dual impact of social media on social and environmental sustainability. Positive impacts include promoting sustainable consumer behaviour, facilitating corporate social responsibility campaigns, improving brand perceptions and increasing engagement with sustainability topics. However, unintended consequences of social media can propagate issues like greenwashing, overconsumption, promotion of extremist views, and misinformation. The implications of this study might be used by digital policymakers, organisations and individuals who seek to exploit these platforms for sustainable development.","Environmental Sustainability; Social Media; Social Media Effects; Social Media Impact; Social Sustainability; Sustainability; Consumer Behavior; Environmental Impact; Social Behavior; Social Networking (online); Sustainable Development Goals; Environmental Sustainability; Medium Effect; Social And Environmental; Social Media; Social Medium Effect; Social Medium Impact; Social Sustainability; Systematic Literature Review; Sustainable Development","Consumer behavior; Environmental impact; Social behavior; Social networking (online); Sustainable development goals; Environmental sustainability; Medium effect; Social and environmental; Social media; Social medium effect; Social medium impact; Social sustainability; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development","","Abbas, Jaffar, The effects of corporate social responsibility practices and environmental factors through a moderating role of social media marketing on sustainable performance of business firms, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 12, (2019); Adenle, Yusuf A., Exploring the usage of social media in extant campus sustainability assessment frameworks for sustainable campus development, International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 23, 1, pp. 135-158, (2022); Agarwal, Neha Dhruv, Leveraging social media to examine sustainability communication of home appliance brands, Technology in Society, 77, (2024); Ai, Pengya, Adolescents’ social media use and their voluntary garbage sorting intentions: A sequential mediation model, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 15, (2021); Aiswarya, U.

This study examines the impact of firm digitalisation on ESG performance and its mechanisms using sample data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2011 to 2023. The results show that firm digitalisation can significantly improve ESG performance, and both management ability as an internal governance mechanism and institutional investors as an external governance mechanism can reinforce this improvement. A mechanism test reveals that improvements in the quality of internal control, total factor productivity, and information transparency are potential channels. Moreover, the effect of digitalisation on ESG performance is more significant for firms with a low supplier concentration and high government subsidies. The effect of digitalisation on ESG performance improvement is more significant for firms located in regions with a high environmental regulation intensity and a good level of digital economy development. In addition, compared to the corporate governance (G) dimension, digitalisation is more effective in improving environmental (E) and social responsibility (S) performance. This study, based on stakeholder theory and upper echelons theory, reveals the mechanisms and boundaries through which firm digitalisation enhances ESG performance, providing a reference for leveraging digital technologies to empower ESG governance and promote high-quality corporate development.","Esg Performance; Firm Digitalisation; Institutional Investors; Management Ability; Sustainable Development","","This paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 72374222; 71904208).

Methods: This exploratory, longitudinal, and mixed-methods study examined a 10% sample of all posts published by this company during the study period. Posts were analyzed in terms of food categories, media and connectivity features, and advertising themes. Results: The company predominantly promoted unhealthy foods, frequently employing persuasive digital marketing strategies. While this pattern was consistent across both platforms, IG posts were more visually engaging and interactive, making greater use of brand elements, hashtags, conversations, emoticons, user interaction, and company tagging (all p < 0.001). In contrast, FB posts more commonly included external links. Twelve distinct advertising themes were identified. They reflected a broad and diverse range of marketing strategies, encompassing brand promotion, user engagement, contextual appeals, technological features, social responsibility, and other themes. IG posts more frequently featured themes such as entertainment and social interaction, consumption stimulus, application differentials, public figure endorsements, and social and corporate responsibility (all p < 0.05). Conversely, the theme of communication and news was more prevalent on FB. Longitudinal analysis revealed that the company adapted its content over time, refining its use of media tools and thematic strategies in response to evolving digital marketing. Conclusion: The company primarily advertised unhealthy foods on both social media, leveraging persuasive techniques and marketing strategies.

Consequently, customers prefer governments more than firms to regulate AI, whereas AI service firms must strive to achieve legitimacy among customers. To address the dearth of relevant research, we conducted a multimethod investigation comprising four studies. The analysis of multinational survey data and a Facebook Ads experiment showed that customers’ concern about AI (“AI concern”) increases their preference for government regulation versus firms’ self-regulation of AI. In the nine countries sampled, the preference for government regulation was stronger in materialist (vs. post-materialist) cultures and where regulatory quality and technology use were high, but weaker where rule-of-law was high. Subsequently, we examined whether signaling CDR (as self-regulation) and compliance with government regulation mitigate the negative downstream impact of AI concern. When interacting with a custom-built service chatbot, participants’ AI concern reduced their willingness to share data. However, this effect was attenuated by signaling compliance with government regulation (EU AI Act), which also decreased customers’ perceived vulnerability. Hence, rather than positioning CDR efforts solely as self-regulation, AI service firms can build legitimacy by proactively, voluntarily, and explicitly incorporating government regulations into their CDR implementation.","Ai Concern; Ai Ethics; Legitimacy Gap; Signaling","","","Alkire, Linda, RAISE: leveraging responsible AI for service excellence, Journal of Service Management, 35, 4, pp. 490-511, (2024); Belk, Russell V., Ethical issues in service robotics and artificial intelligence, Service Industries Journal, 41, 13-14, pp. 860-876, (2021); Berman, Alexander, Trustworthy AI in the public sector: An empirical analysis of a Swedish labor market decision-support system, Technology in Society, 76, (2024); Bhattacharya, Abhi, Beyond Warm Glow: The Risk-Mitigating Effect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Journal of Business Ethics, 171, 2, pp. 317-336, (2021); Blaurock, Marah, Designing Collaborative Intelligence Systems for Employee-AI Service Co-Production, Journal of Service Research, (2024); Blösser, Myrthe, A consumer perspective of AI certification – the current certification landscape, consumer approval and directions for future research, European Journal of Marketing, 58, 2, pp. 441-470, (2024); Borsci, Simone, Embedding artificial intelligence in society: looking beyond the EU AI master plan using the culture cycle, AI and Society, 38, 4, pp. 1465-1484, (2023); Bouncken, Ricarda B., Legitimacy Processes and Trajectories of Co-Prosumption Services: Insights from Coworking Spaces, Journal of Service Research, 26, 1, pp. 64-82, (2023); Brough, Aaron R., The Bulletproof Glass Effect: Unintended Consequences of Privacy Notices, Journal of Marketing Research, 59, 4, pp. 739-754, (2022); Camilleri, Mark A., Ethical considerations of service organizations in the information age信息时代服务组织的道德思考, Service Industries Journal, 44, 9-10, pp. 634-660, (2024)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","15527379; 10946705","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010350239"

Nevertheless, this innovation has its dark side as well as legal and moral issues are also very complicated, especially liability of corporations to misuse of data and system malfunctions. The presented research describes the loopholes in the current legal systems that are insufficient to deal with the responsibility of companies utilizing AI-based HealthTech systems. The paper critically reviews the real-life examples of DeepMindNHS data-sharing dramas, the case of IBM Watson oncology and the Theranos scandal to highlight the various dangers of algorithmic opacity, absence of informed consent and tendency to be under-regulated. The national and international statutes, case laws, expert interviews, and policy documents are analyzed through the use of a doctrinal legal research methodology supported by a qualitative thematic analysis. These results show that existing legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), HIPAA and the Information Technology Act (India)) provide limited guard since they do not effectively govern AI-generated harm and specify corporate liability. The risk environment is also enhanced by ethical issues, especially those that concern patient autonomy, algorithmic bias, as well as data commodification. The study suggests the legal-ethical framework that focuses on the transparency, distributed liability, governing data, and ethical by design concepts in terms of the development and implementation of the AI systems. Within this framework, the systematic reviews of ethical audits, explanations requirements, and accountability standards incorporated into the corporate governance workbench are promoted. It also maintains the necessity of global regulatory standards that are harmonized to deal with the cross-border characteristic of HealthTech applications. Finally, the paper emphasizes that it is not enough to go by the law but companies have to assume ethical responsibilities to promote societal health, privacy, and confidence. The advanced framework can provide policy-makers, regulators and corporate stakeholders with a map that will enable them to traverse the new legal-ethical landscape of AI in healthcare. The issue of corporate accountability in AI-HealthTech is no longer a legal requirement it is a moral requirement in the digital age.","Algorithmic Accountability; Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Liability; Data Misuse; Ethical Governance; Healthcare Regulation; Healthtech; Legal Framework; Patient Privacy; System Failures","","","Burrell, Jenna, How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms, Big Data and Society, 3, 1, (2016); Floridi, Luciano, AI4People—An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, Principles, and Recommendations, Minds and Machines, 28, 4, pp. 689-707, (2018); Morley, Jessica R., From What to How: An Initial Review of Publicly Available AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices, Science and Engineering Ethics, 26, 4, pp. 2141-2168, (2020); Shabani, Mahsa, Re-identifiability of genomic data and the GDPR: Assessing the re-identifiability of genomic data in light of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, EMBO Reports, 20, 6, (2019); Being Profiling Cogitas Ergo Sum, (2018); University of Chicago Law Review, (2020); Ghassemi, Marzyeh, The false hope of current approaches to explainable artificial intelligence in health care, The Lancet Digital Health, 3, 11, pp. e745-e750, (2021); Hatherley, Joshua James, Limits of trust in medical AI, Journal of Medical Ethics, 46, 7, pp. 478-481, (2020); London, Alex John, Artificial Intelligence and Black-Box Medical Decisions: Accuracy versus Explainability, Hastings Center Report, 49, 1, pp. 15-21, (2019); Mittelstadt, Brent Daniel, Ethics of the health-related internet of things: a narrative review, Ethics and Information Technology, 19, 3, pp. 157-175, (2017)","","Academic Science Publications and Distributions","22297359","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010293911"

This research investigates the impact of AI adoption on corporate green investment (CGI) based on the sample of China's A-share listed companies (2008–2022). By employing econometric techniques to examine panel data, an instrument variable with a two-stage least squares approach, the Heckman selection model, and a series of robustness tests, this research finds that AI adoption positively correlates with CGI. The mechanism analysis reveals that AI adoption curbs managerial myopia and enhances technological resources to drive green investment levels. Moreover, the impact of AI adoption on CGI is pronounced when companies are headed by younger CEOs, those with higher education qualifications, and those with global exposure. This research enhances our overall comprehension of how digital innovation may be strategically utilized to promote sustainable development.

However, the transition back to solely traditional online channels following live-stream events presents decision-making challenges for firms regarding dynamic pricing, price commitment, and price matching schemes, particularly when dealing with strategic customers. We develop a two-period theoretical model to explore the selection of pricing schemes by a firm who may launch a live-streaming sales. Our analysis reveals that while live-streaming cannot necessarily enhance profitability under price commitment scheme, it significantly boosts profits under dynamic pricing and price matching schemes due to amplified pricing flexibility. The increased customer patience in strategic waiting diminishes the benefits of live-streaming under dynamic pricing, whereas it enhances them under price matching with reimbursement mechanisms. Moreover, dynamic pricing and price matching schemes, traditionally perceived as less favorable, emerge as potentially more effective due to the real-time value enhancement effect of live-streaming commerce, which can mitigate customers’ strategic delay in purchasing decisions. The firm's selection of an optimal pricing scheme under live-streaming commerce can also maximize consumer surplus, thereby enhancing social welfare and promoting a positive image of corporate social responsibility advocated by governmental bodies. This “win-win-win” scenario for the firm, customers, and government can be achieved through dynamic pricing or price commitment schemes. In this context, a conducive social environment can be fostered, enabling all participants to collaborate in expanding opportunities and benefiting everyone.","Live-streaming Marketing; Strategic Customers; Supply Chain Management; Two-period Pricing; Commerce; Costs; Decision Making; Economic And Social Effects; Profitability; Sales; Social Aspects; Chain Management; Commitment Scheme; Dynamic Price; Dynamic Pricing; Live Streaming; Live-streaming Marketing; Matching Scheme; Pricing Scheme; Strategic Customer; Two-period Pricing; Supply Chain Management","Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Sales; Social aspects; Chain management; Commitment scheme; Dynamic price; Dynamic pricing; Live streaming; Live-streaming marketing; Matching scheme; Pricing scheme; Strategic customer; Two-period pricing; Supply chain management","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 72201156 , 72201016 ]; the National Social Science Fund of China [No. 24BGL100 ]; the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Science Project of China [Nos. 22YJC630010 , 22YJC630120 , and 23YJA630104 ]; the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China [No. ZR2024QG150 ]; the Social Science Planning Project of Shandong Province of China [No. 22DGLJ17 ].","Ahmadi, Iman, Time preferences and the pricing of complementary durables and consumables, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 34, 4, pp. 813-828, (2017); Manufacturing Service Operations Management, (2008); Beetsma, Roel M.W.J., An analysis of the stability and growth pact, Economic Journal, 109, 458, pp. 546-571, (1999); Cachon, Gérard P., Purchasing, pricing, and quick response in the presence of strategic consumers, Management Science, 55, 3, pp. 497-511, (2009); Chen, Pingping, Promoting end-of-season product through online channel in an uncertain market, European Journal of Operational Research, 295, 3, pp. 935-948, (2021); Cohen-Vernik, Dinah A., Price Adjustment Policy with Partial Refunds, Journal of Retailing, 93, 4, pp. 507-526, (2017); Dasu, Sriram, Dynamic pricing when consumers are strategic: Analysis of posted and contingent pricing schemes, European Journal of Operational Research, 204, 3, pp. 662-671, (2010); Du, Peng, Pricing competition on innovative product between innovator and entrant imitator facing strategic customers, International Journal of Production Research, 56, 5, pp. 1806-1824, (2018); Geng, Xin, Duopoly price competition with quality improvement spillover, Naval Research Logistics, 69, 7, pp. 958-973, (2022); Hao, Caixia, Resale or agency sale?

It examines the indirect effects of CSR publicity via media coverage on green vehicle sales by analyzing the mediating role of Instagram-based electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), offering a clearer understanding of how communication prompts consumer response and leads to purchasing behavior. Research Design and Methodology: Using monthly panel data from 22 automotive brands over a 29-month period (610 observations), we analyze the causal pathway from CSR news exposure to Instagram engagement and subsequent green vehicle sales. The volume of Instagram posts is treated as a proxy for consumer-generated eWOM. Findings: Our results show that eco-friendly CSR news reports significantly increase Instagram eWOM, which in turn contributes to higher sales of eco-friendly vehicles. This confirms the mediating role of social media engagement in translating CSR communication into real market behavior. Conclusions: This study is the first to empirically demonstrate the indirect effect of CSR news coverage on actual product-level outcomes via eWOM in the South Korean automotive industry. The findings offer new insights into how firms can strategically amplify CSR impact by leveraging third-party media and consumer-driven communication channels.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Eco-friendly Csr; Green Vehicle Distribution; Instagram Postings; Social Media Engagement; South Korean Automotive Industry","","","Barta, Sergio, Influencer marketing on TikTok: The effectiveness of humor and followers’ hedonic experience, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 70, (2023); Barnea, Amir, Corporate Social Responsibility as a Conflict Between Shareholders, Journal of Business Ethics, 97, 1, pp. 71-86, (2010); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

The digital screen is used as a framing device to examine what was communicated to fashion consumers and how this communication occurred during lockdown. Lockdowns accelerated the primacy of screens in fashion communication. While fashion communication encompasses a variety of practices, this article focuses on the marketing and online advertising approaches used by fashion brands to position face coverings as desirable accessories during the pandemic. Screens did not merely provide representations of face coverings, but through imagery, descriptions and links, they served as conduits to imagine the ways in which wearers might experience and style this new accessory. Fashion brands further emphasized how mask production or consumption contributed to responsible (corporate) citizenship and charitable initiatives, or related to sustainability. During the pandemic, these strategies responded to the criticism that the fashion industry was taking advantage of the demand for this new accessory for profit. However, in considering the mask’s materialization from screen to embodied experience, I also apply the other use definition of screen: to obscure or hide. This article argues that the emphasis of certain sustainable features of cloth masks drew attention away from the many other ways in which masks did not conform to circular design and that local and corporate initiatives obscured rather than addressed the worsened plight of garment workers. The ease with which digital fashion communication can be updated allowed fashion brands to remove references to initiatives once wearing masks became normalized and the market was saturated. I argue that the evidence reveals an industry practising business as usual, positioning itself in the best possible light through digital communication and marketing, rather than affecting systematic change: a lost opportunity for all.","Cloth Masks; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Digital Screens; Face Masks; Fashion; Sustainability","","","Allen, Kim, Welfare Queens, Thrifty Housewives, and Do-It-All Mums: Celebrity motherhood and the cultural politics of austerity, Feminist Media Studies, 15, 6, pp. 907-925, (2015); Adult Reusable Cotton Mask Hannah Blue Liberty, (2020); Abandoned the Impact of Covid 19 on Workers and Businesses at the Bottom of Global Garment Supply Chains, (2020); Vogue Business, (2020); Coronavirus Uk to Be Guided by Scientists on Face Masks, (2020); How to Make A Face Covering at Home Angeline Murphy, (2020); How to Make A Face Covering at Home Elisalex De Castro Peake, (2020); How to Make A Face Covering at Home Mollymakescakes, (2020); Bluteau, Joshua M., Undercover—From Necessity to Luxury: The Evolution of Face Coverings during COVID-19, Fashion Theory - Journal of Dress Body and Culture, 27, 1, pp. 157-164, (2023); Non Medical Face Covering Multi, (2020)","","Intellect Ltd.","20500726; 20500734","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008670344"

This curated article argues that to imagine the future of corporate actors in a world that is rapidly changing due to the possibilities of digital technology and sustainability challenges, we also need to revisit dominant conceptualizations of the corporate actor in economic or social science research. The four essays included in this article draw on different theories to elaborate on the role that corporate actors play, could play, or should play in the future. The problems that the authors identify in their essays include the power and wrongdoing of corporate actors; the ability of corporate actors to create their environment, not just react to it; the lack of a concept of (corporate) responsibility capable of responding to the desiderata of society; and the accountability of corporate actorhood outside the boundaries of formal organizations. By providing reflections on these problems, this article—written against the background of the historical peculiarities of German business administration research marked by a neglect of collectivist concepts such as corporate actors—shows that research and society actively co-construct the roles and responsibilities of corporate actors. The performativity of theories addressing corporate actors is thus a concern for business administration scholars aiming to contribute to a more sustainable future.","Actorhood; B3; B4; Corporate Actor; Fiction; German Bwl; L29; N44; Organization Theory; Power; Responsibility; Z10","","","Agazzi, Evandro, Philosophy of Science and Ethics, Axiomathes, 28, 6, pp. 587-602, (2018); Ahrne, Göran, Meta-organizations, (2008); Ahrne, Göran, Organization outside organizations: The significance of partial organization, Organization, 18, 1, pp. 83-104, (2011); Ahrne, Göran, Organization outside organizations: The abundance of partial organization in social life, pp. 1-443, (2019); Ahrne, Göran, Resurrecting organization by going beyond organizations, European Management Journal, 34, 2, pp. 93-101, (2016); American Economic Review, (1972); Alford, John, Making sense of public value: Concepts, critiques and emergent meanings, International Journal of Public Administration, 32, 3-4, pp. 171-191, (2009); Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, (2021); How to do Things with Words, (1962); Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, (2005)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","23666153; 03412687","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008248929"

Sustainable leaders prioritize collaboration, consensus-building, and support for team members to collectively achieve shared objectives, particularly those set by diverse stakeholders. This qualitative study employed a semi-structured interview methodology to explore sustainability leadership within the hospitality sector. All interviews were conducted via online platforms and examined using thematic analysis. The sample included 10 hotel managers from various lodging establishments in Portugal, comprising four men (40%) and six women (60%). Participants' ages ranged from below 30 to 50 years, with one manager under 30, five between 31 and 40, and four between 41 and 50. In the context of organizational sustainability, participants emphasized the importance of a long-term perspective, safety considerations, and corporate social responsibility. Half of the respondents indicated the presence of sustainability-specific policies, largely derived from group policies or specific sustainability-focused project requirements. Most participants reported that sustainability is integrated into their organization's vision and mission, with several referencing the European Union Green Deal and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as key frameworks guiding their strategies. The majority of participants assessed their digital proficiency as advanced, even within complex operational contexts. Organizational digitalization levels were generally advanced, although some organizations were identified at an intermediate digitalization stage. Furthermore, social dimensions of sustainability and soft skills were regarded as essential for sustainable leadership in hospitality. The most highly valued leadership soft skills included solution-oriented thinking, resilience, critical thinking, communication, and team cohesion, whereas time management was identified as a lesser priority. These findings underscore the significance of sustainability for managers in the hospitality sector, though the degree of implementation varies across lodging types and different sustainability dimensions.","Hospitality; Skills; Sustainability; Sustainable Leadership; Tourism","","Project funded by Erasmus+ Programme European Union - PT01-KA220-VET-000088349.","European Proceedings of Social Behavioural Sciences, (2022); Aydın, Birgül, Sustainable urban tourism success factors and the economic performance of small tourism enterprises, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 23, 10, pp. 975-988, (2018); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Carlisle, Sheena, The digital skills divide: evidence from the European tourism industry, Journal of Tourism Futures, 9, 2, pp. 240-266, (2023); Chen, Han, Greenwashing in hotels: A structural model of trust and behavioral intentions, Journal of Cleaner Production, 206, pp. 326-335, (2019); Cheng, Tienming, How do environmental knowledge, environmental sensitivity, and place attachment affect environmentally responsible behavior?

So, the present research examines the application of blockchain (BC) technology to enhance the donation tracking Platform, which delivers data immutability, and transaction transparency, as well as peer-to-peer transactions, as well as it is all the rage in today's technological period. BC enables the tracking of every donation, by permitting the donors to track the usage of their funds. The three primary roles of the present research are nongovernmental organization, Donors, as well as scholar beneficiaries. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds of industries are considered as donations, which causes educational scholarship for the initial prototype building. Subsequently, this prototype is scalable to every feasible field of educational scholarship as well as other methods of philanthropy. Thus, a Crypto-Go-Charity is proposed to solve the problems of the supply chain by utilizing the Ethereum BC and delivering a more secure and immutable ecosystem for scholarships.

The scope of these provisions is thus incredibly broad and they have unsurprisingly attracted significant academic interest. So far, most scholarship has taken a broadly functionalist approach: it accepts the basic premise that certain social impacts of platforms constitute risks which must be managed, and evaluates the DSA's capacity to achieve this 'effectively'. In contrast, this article aims to step back and critically reflect on the underlying conceptual and institutional framework of systemic risk management, based on an explicitly social constructionist understanding of risk as a technology of governance shaped by competing political agendas. Drawing on critical literature on risk regulation from various disciplines and regulatory fields, it identifies two key themes. First, discursively framing political problems as risks tends to exclude issues less amenable to the 'risk' framing; to privilege technocratic expertise; and to depoliticise distributive and ideological conflicts. Second, the DSA's institutional approach to risk regulation delegates primary responsibility for identifying and managing risks to regulated companies, creating well-documented risks of capture. Overall, both themes point to similar conclusions: the systemic risk framework will be highly favourable to the interests of the powerful multinational corporations it seeks to regulate. In conclusion, however, the article notes that platform regulation may pose distinctive challenges that are not well illuminated by scholarship on risk regulation in other fields - notably because of the widely-recognised possibilities for political abuse of more prescriptive regulation of online media. It suggests some avenues for further research into risk politics in the specific context of online media platforms, in particular drawing on scholarship on risk management in critical security studies.","Digital Services Act; Platform Regulation; Risk Regulation; Technology Law","","","Selected Non Fictions, (1999); Regulation Eu 2022 2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on A Single Market for Digital Services and Amending Directive 2000 31 EC Digital Services Act, (2022); undefined; undefined; Dsas Industrial Model for Content Moderation; Tzouvala, Ntina, CAPITALISM AS CIVILISATION: A History of International Law, pp. 1-268, (2020); Government of Risk Understanding Risk Regulation Regimes, (2001); Risk Society Towards A New Modernity, (1992); Kaminski, Margot E., REGULATING THE RISKS OF AI, Boston University Law Review, 103, 5, pp. 1347-1411, (2023); Digital Services Act Risk Based Regulation of Online Platforms, (2021)","","Cambridge University Press","27526135","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007510371"

The review reveals that consumer skepticism plays a dual role: it promotes critical thinking and informed decision-making but may also cause distrust, emotional discomfort, and lower brand engagement. Often viewed negatively, skepticism serves as a protective mechanism against deceptive marketing, influencing consumer-brand relationships, particularly in the digital market. The findings underscore the need for further research into skepticism’s impact, especially in digital marketing and CSR initiatives. Future studies should explore strategies that balance the protective benefits of skepticism with its potential to undermine consumer trust and engagement.","Consumer Skepticism; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Consumer Behavior; Marketing Ethics; Prisma 2020; Systematic Literature Review","","","Dalal, Bassam, How brand symbolism, perceived service quality, and CSR skepticism influence consumers to engage in citizenship behavior, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Janssen, Catherine, Is a specific claim always better?

Sensory marketing, engaging in all five senses, has become a vital band strategy significantly impacting consumer perceptions, decisions, and behaviors. The study emphasizes the dominance of the United States, with notable contributions from China, the United Kingdom, and France. Leading institutions such as The Ohio State University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University have played crucial roles in this field. Thematic evolution reveals a shift from initial research on hospitality and neuroscience to current focuses on consumer behavior in digital commerce and the integration of emerging technologies like virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence. This trend underscores the importance of immersive, personalized experiences in shaping consumer behavior and brand loyalty. The study also highlights a dual focus on understanding sensory stimuli’s impact on behavior and exploring their role in promoting sustainable consumption and corporate social responsibility. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding sensory marketing’s trajectory and offers practical insights for marketers, highlighting the strategic use of sensory elements to enhance consumer engagement and loyalty.","Bibliometric; Consumer Behavior; Consumer Psychology; Experiential; Marketing; Relationship Marketing; Senses; Sensory Marketing","","The authors sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their insightful feedback and constructive comments.

This study constructs a three-echelon PSSC considering the network externality and the corporate social responsibility (CSR) based on the Stackelberg game. The optimal solutions under centralized and decentralized decisions are given, and comparative analyses among different models are presented. The research objective of this paper is to clarify the contribution of network externality and CSR to the value creation of stakeholders in the process of digital servitization. The results show that network externality always increases the service price, service level, profit, and the product and service CSR levels. The concern of manufacturers and retailers for product and service CSR investments influences the decision of PSSC. In the cooperative service provision model, the increased customer numbers can directly improve the service price, service level and service CSR level, but the overall benefit is less than the model where manufacturers conduct service self-operating or outsourcing.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Servitization; Network Externality; Product Service Supply Chain; Servitization Model; Forming; Cooperative Services; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Servitization; Network Externality; Product Service; Product Service Supply Chain; Service Supply Chains; Servitization; Servitization Model; Sales","Forming; Cooperative services; Corporate social responsibility; Digital servitization; Network externality; Product service; Product service supply chain; Service supply chains; Servitization; Servitization model; Sales","This work was supported by the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX21_3313; KYCX22_3593).","Smith, Laura A., Servitization and operations management: A service dominant-logic approach, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 34, 2, pp. 242-269, (2014); Khanra, Sayantan, Servitization research: A review and bibliometric analysis of past achievements and future promises, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 151-166, (2021); Wang, Weijiao, The impact of servitization on firm performance: a meta-analysis, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 38, 7, pp. 1562-1588, (2018); Jat, Mohsin Nasir, Manufacturer's servitization level and financial performance: the role of risk management, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 34, 1, pp. 122-146, (2023); Paschou, Theoni, Digital servitization in manufacturing: A systematic literature review and research agenda, Industrial Marketing Management, 89, pp. 278-292, (2020); Favoretto, Camila, From servitization to digital servitization: How digitalization transforms companies' transition towards services, Industrial Marketing Management, 102, pp. 104-121, (2022); Alqahtani, Ammar Y., Warranty and maintenance analysis of sensor embedded products using internet of things in industry 4.0, International Journal of Production Economics, 208, pp. 483-499, (2019); Wang, Hua, The impact of network externalities and altruistic preferences on carbon emission reduction of low carbon supply chain, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 44, pp. 66259-66276, (2022); Wei, Wanying, CSR investment for a two-sided platform: Network externality and risk aversion, European Journal of Operational Research, 307, 2, pp. 694-712, (2023); Ayala, Néstor Fabián, Knowledge sharing dynamics in service suppliers' involvement for servitization of manufacturing companies, International Journal of Production Economics, 193, pp. 538-553, (2017)","","Springer","13895753","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005103643"

However, studies examining CDR in the hospitality and tourism industry remain limited, particularly in terms of the challenges involved. Thus, this study aims to explore the decision-making processes related to CDR barriers, attitudinal ambivalence and compliance intentions toward CDR initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from employees in the U.S. hospitality and tourism industry through an online survey. The analysis primarily involved confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis to assess the results. Findings: The barriers of “lack of awareness,” “economic constraints” and “technological complexity,” but not “lack of organizational focus,” negatively influenced compliance intentions. However, all four barriers positively affected attitudinal ambivalence. In addition, employees’ attitudinal ambivalence significantly and indirectly affected compliance intentions. Finally, the moderating role of organizational trust was partially confirmed. Originality/value: This research fills a critical gap in the study of CDR in the hospitality and tourism industry by focusing on barriers to its implementation during digital transformation. While corporate social responsibility benefits have received considerable attention, this study uniquely examines CDR challenges from the employee perspective, highlighting their role as key implementers. Applying social identity theory and incorporating organizational trust as a moderating factor, it offers actionable insights for overcoming barriers, reducing ambivalence and strengthening employee compliance with CDR initiatives.","Attitudinal Ambivalence; Cdr Barriers; Compliance Intentions; Organizational Trust; Social Identity Theory","","","Afaq, Anam, A critical insight into the intersection of sustainability and technology, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 37, 1, pp. 239-259, (2025); International Journal of Business Economics and Management, (2016); Ali, Muhammad, Green management practices and trust for green behavioral intentions and mediation of ethical leadership.

However, little is known regarding whether consumers can capture the core values that companies project through their corporate political advocacy efforts, or how the perceived core values affect consumers’ perceptual evaluation and behavioral responses. This study aims to examine how value congruence between a company and its consumers motivates consumer support for the company's political advocacy stance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a two-wave longitudinal survey, this study examined how shared benevolence-caring and universalism-concern affected consumers’ assessment of corporate political advocacy. Findings: The results revealed that congruent social-focus values (benevolence-caring and universalism-concern) were positively associated with supportive behaviors when consumers felt shared responsibility for the betterment of the sentiment community. Originality/value: Through a longitudinal approach and the normative lens of value congruence and shared responsibility, the study demonstrates the importance of building a company’s virtuous character and ethical persona with benevolence-caring and universalism-concern via corporate political advocacy, for example, showing concerns not only for stakeholders but more importantly, the public interests of the broad society, helps to increase consumers’ identification with the company.","Benevolence-caring; Buycotting; Consumer Digital Engagement; Corporate Political Advocacy; Shared Responsibility; Universalism-concern; Value Congruence","","","Weve Lost the Right to Be Pessimistic Patagonia Treads Fine Line Tackling Climate Crisis as for Profit Company, (2023); Lgbtiq Equality; After Protests Disney Ceo Speaks Out Against Floridas Dont Say Gay Bill, (2022); Lyft and Uber Will Pay Drivers Legal Fees if Theyre Sued Under Texas Abortion Law, (2021); Bowen, Shannon A., Clarifying ethics terms in public relations from A to V, authenticity to virtue: BledCom special issue of PR review sleeping (with the) media: Media relations, Public Relations Review, 42, 4, pp. 564-572, (2016); Cazier, Joseph A., Value congruence, trust, and their effects on purchase intention and reservation price, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, 8, 4, (2017); Chaves, Olga C., Association of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance in bipolar disorder: A longitudinal study, Bipolar Disorders, 13, 1, pp. 118-123, (2011); Chun, Rosa, How Virtuous Global Firms Say They Are: A Content Analysis of Ethical Values, Journal of Business Ethics, 155, 1, pp. 57-73, (2019); Ciszek, Erica L., Challenging the dialogic promise: how Ben & Jerry’s support for Black Lives Matter fosters dissensus on social media, Journal of Public Relations Research, 30, 3, pp. 115-127, (2018); Clark, David B., THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY: A RE‐EXAMINATION, Sociological Review, 21, 3, pp. 397-416, (1973)","","Emerald Publishing","17471117; 1758857X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004677559"

This study investigates whether the convergence of these two forces can foster innovation and sustainability, particularly within the complex socio-economic context of the MENA region. Grounded in stakeholder and dynamic capabilities theories, the research examines how CG structures influence SBP, with digital transformation serving as a moderating factor. Using panel data from 462 listed manufacturing firms (2010–2022) and employing advanced econometric techniques, the findings reveal that diversity-related governance variables—such as board expertise, gender, and age diversity—positively influence SBP, while nationality diversity has a negative effect. Structural governance elements, including board interlock, board size, and CEO duality, also enhance SBP, whereas board independence is negatively associated. Digital transformation significantly amplifies the effectiveness of CG mechanisms on SBP, with heterogeneous effects observed across industries and ownership structures. Cluster analysis highlights notable industry-specific differences in governance impacts. These findings support the implementation of context-sensitive, industry-specific policies aimed at strengthening board governance and digital capabilities as strategic levers for sustainable development.","Corporate Governance; Corporate Governance Mechanisms; Corporate Social Responsibility & Business Ethics; Digital Transformation; Middle East And North Africa (mena); Sustainable Business Practices; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals (sdg)","","","Adam, Ibrahim, Firms and the path to circular economy: unveiling the impact of ownership dynamics and innovation capacity through advanced econometric and quantile regression analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 12, 1, (2025); Agovino, Massimiliano, Corporate governance and sustainability in water utilities.

This study explores research lines on the relationship between IA functions and ESG, thereby opening up further research trends. Design/methodology/approach: Accessing systematic literature review through the dataset from Scopus source, 34 articles were included in the analysis after complying with PRISMA screening principles. The data analysis process is supported by the VOSviewer tool. Findings: We clarify the effects of IA on ESG (positive, negative, or insignificant) using the theory and context of prior studies, as well as provide difficulties for future research. In addition, this paper discusses limits and future research ideas. The findings indicate a favorable link between IA functions and ESG. IA functions are actively involved in ESG concerns, ranging from ESG practices and performance to ESG disclosure. Furthermore, there is a link between IA functions and ESG disclosure that improves organizational effectiveness (for example, firm value). As a result, these perspectives offer substantial support for business managers, keeping employees, and future scholars in this context. Research limitations/implications: The perspectives of this study emphasize the positive role of IA functions and their sensitivity to sustainable performance by stressing ESG practices, performance, and reporting in businesses, hence boosting the firm’s value and competitive position. As a result, business managers can make decisions to increase IA functions (for example, supporting the usage of recently integrated digital systems or tools) as a method of achieving long-term growth by improving performance and disclosing ESG practices. Furthermore, these ideas are advantageous to policymakers since they promote the establishment of rules and procedures for IA functions in businesses, hence increasing the levels of sustainable development that they seek to achieve. This study also provides prospective research subjects that might be pursued by assessing the issues experienced in previous research projects. Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive and reliable view of research lines on the relationship between IA functions and ESG using a systematic literature review method.","Audit Committee; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Social And Governance; Internal Audit; Sustainability Reporting","","","Abbott, Lawrence J., The Real Effects of Internal Audit Function Quality: Evidence From Investment Strategies, Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 39, 2, pp. 540-567, (2024); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Environmental, social and governance practices: A new perspective from Asian developing countries, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 32, 1, pp. 1079-1095, (2025); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure quality in developing countries: evidence from the ASEAN region, Corporate Governance (Bingley), (2025); Adams, Michael B., Agency Theory and the Internal Audit, Managerial Auditing Journal, 9, 8, pp. 8-12, (1994); Abu Afifa, Malik Muneer, Accounting information quality in the digital era – a perspective from ERP system adoption?, Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication, 74, 5-6, pp. 2022-2046, (2025); Al Amosh, Hamzeh, COVID-19 impact, financial and ESG performance: Evidence from G20 countries, Business Strategy and Development, 6, 3, pp. 310-321, (2023); Alessa, Noha A., Does stakeholder pressure influence firms environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure?

This study turns attention to the spectacle in the age of social media. Building on a growing body of research on the spectacle of suffering, we compare reactions to the 2022 Itaewon Halloween stampede, which claimed more than 150 lives, across Korean-language and English-language posts on the social networking platform, X (previously Twitter). Our research draws on two computational techniques, topic modeling and network analysis, to examine the emotive and evaluative character of the discourse as well as its structural features. The analysis reveals significant differences between the two corpora. While the English-language network, in which corporate media accounts are most prominent, dehumanizes the victims and parrots the official version of events, the Korean-language network, driven by ordinary users, evinces empathy and draws attention to administrative failures – serving as a prelude to large-scale protests across South Korea that forced the government to concede its responsibility for the tragedy. We argue that even though the spectacle remains relevant as a concept to understand mediatized public life today, it is not quite as monolithic as it was originally conceptualized. Instead, the logics of social networking have rendered a fractured spectacle, with different networked publics producing different representations of and reactions to public events in the digital attention economy – leading to different political consequences.","Affective Public; Crowd Crush; Network Analysis; Seoul; South Korea; Suffering; Topic Modeling; Twitter","","","Simulacra and Simulation Trans, (1994); Cinematic Mode of Production Attention Economy and the Society of the Spectacle, (2006); Illuminations, (1969); Blei, David M., Probabilistic topic models, Communications of the ACM, 55, 4, pp. 77-84, (2012); Networked Self Identity Community and Culture on Social Network Sites, (2010); Brantner, Cornelia, Visibility in the Digital Age: Introduction, Studies in Communication Sciences, 21, 1, pp. 93-98, (2021); Sage Handbook of Social Media, (2018); Tanner Lectures on Human Values, (2013); Hybrid Media System Politics and Power, (2013); Choi, Jin A., Infodemiological study on the use of face masks during covid-19: Comparing U.S. and Korea, Drustvena Istrazivanja, 30, 2, pp. 359-378, (2021)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","13548565; 17487382","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004298811"

Here, we discuss these implications and connect them to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8.5, 8.6, and 9.1. AI increases efficiency and personalization in educational environments but also poses threats such as job redundancy and ethical dilemmas within academic and professional arenas. Economists are unclear on its cost-impacting effects on labor availability, but state that its quick integration may also mean its role in displacing jobs, thus risking SDG 8.5 to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all. This growing demand for AI-enabled skills drives a crucial demand for workforce adaptability. Notably, SDG 8.6 emphasizes the risks posed to young people seeking employment and training opportunities, with many young people being left behind, unable to access new opportunities in the AI sector. Policy implications: It is necessary to have targeted policies to address these risks that promote upskilling, which will reduce the rate of young people not in education, employment, or training (NEET). In addition, the reliance on resilient digital infrastructures for integrating AI in educational activities is a call towards SDG 9.1」. Access to AI-driven tools must be equitable to avoid socio-economic divides and ensure the equitable growth of academic and industrial ecosystems. This study highlights the need to regulate and ethically govern technological progress in order to ensure that it is balanced with social responsibility. Through strategic alignment with AI driven change and sustainable employment approaches, stakeholders might be able to counteract adverse effects and maximise the potential of AI for educational and workforce transformation in the longer term.","Ai In Commerce; Artificial Intelligence (ai); Consumer Perceptions; Corporate Accountability; Employment Impact","","","Impact of AI on Hiring Legal and Ethical Considerations, (2024); Navigating Ethical Challenges in AI Advancements, (2024); Aldoseri, Abdulaziz, Re-Thinking Data Strategy and Integration for Artificial Intelligence: Concepts, Opportunities, and Challenges, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 12, (2023); Ali, Sanna J., Walking the Walk of AI Ethics: Organizational Challenges and the Individualization of Risk among Ethics Entrepreneurs, pp. 217-226, (2023); Asan, Onur, Artificial Intelligence–Based Consumer Health Informatics Application: Scoping Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); Journal of Cleaner Production, (2023); Role of Ethical Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management, (2023); Human Resource Management Journal, (2023); Ethical Implications of AI and the Future of Work, (2024); Georgieff, Alexandre, Artificial Intelligence and Employment: New Cross-Country Evidence, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 5, (2022)","Cirnu, C.E.; Ciuperca, E.M.","National Institute for R and D in Informatics","29719291; 18448933","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003584852"

The third wave, characterized by innovations in information technology and Internet, changed human lifestyle fundamentally and generated a new five trillion-dollar IT industry. The fourth wave is characterized by structural change based on digital networks. Meanwhile, growth and growth potential sometimes can be a tradeoff. Growth came at the cost of further worsening climate change, energy, and demographic crises. As a response to address these challenges, the fifth wave is characterized by sustainable growth so that myopic growth does not depreciate growth potential.

This precision revolution has been lauded by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as critical to advancing U.S. interests while avoiding the dire humanitarian consequences of comprehensive sanctions. The transition from the metaphorical shotgun to the scalpel has collided with another seismic change in geopolitics: rising corporate influence in global affairs, particularly by digital network providers. The growing role of private power was on full display during the mass corporate exodus from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. These voluntary corporate withdrawals—which this Article calls ""corporate sanctions ""—can, in combination with OFAC's targeted sanctions, effectively reinstate the comprehensive sanctions of eras past. Digitalization has amplified the potential consequences, as ""de-risking"" by digital network providers can erode efforts to counteract harmful cyber operations, oppose the spread of virulent political narratives, and mobilize opposition to hostile regimes. While de-risking results from a complex array of factors, a legal anachronism bears much responsibility: OFAC's seldom-used but large-looming authority to charge civil sanctions violations on a strict-liability basis without regard for knowledge or intent. Even as OF AC goes to great lengths to distance practical enforcement decisions from strict liability, the threat of zero-tolerance enforcement is a Sword of Damocles over corporate actors, producing harmful de-risking incentives that can undermine OFAC's precision revolution as well as broader strategic and humanitarian goals. This Article proposes three solutions: first, abandoning strict liability in sanctions enforcement; second, amending OFAC's Enforcement Guidelines to treat the provision of digital network technology intended for civilian use the same as humanitarian goods and services when considering enforcement outcomes; and third, publicly disclosing OFAC's decisions concerning applications for specific licenses.","","","","L A Times, (2022); National Interest, (1989); Fed Foreign Off Speech by Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, (2023); Targeting Key Sectors Evasion Efforts and Military Supplies Treasury Expands and Intensifies Sanctions Against Russia, (2023); Private Sanctions, (2023); Political Science Quarterly, (1994); Yale Sch Mgmt Chief Exec Leadership Inst, (2023); Inv Monitor, (2023); undefined; New Yorker, (2022)","","Columbia Law Review Association","00101931","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001944670"

As hospitality organizations adopt digital technologies, they face complex ethical, societal, and environmental challenges, including data privacy concerns, the ethical use of AI, and the environmental impact of digital operations. CDR offers a framework for addressing these issues, ensuring businesses balance innovation with responsibility. Through a systematic review of the CDR literature, this paper identifies key themes, frameworks, and challenges that shape current understandings of digital responsibility. It also highlights critical research gaps, such as the lack of universal standards, regional variations in digital responsibility practices, and the challenges of aligning ethical frameworks with business strategies. The paper suggests future research directions, focusing on the effectiveness of CDR initiatives, the role of regulatory frameworks, and the impact of technological advancements. Ultimately, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on how organizations can integrate CDR into their strategies, ensuring a sustainable and ethical digital transformation that benefits both businesses and society.","Corporate Digital Responsibility (cdr); Data Privacy; Digital Technologies; Ethical Challenges; Sustainable Digital Transformation","","","Latapí, Mauricio, Drivers that motivate energy companies to be responsible.

However, consideration of the (negative) impacts of digital technologies is often neglected, despite increasing public and regulatory demands for accountability and strategic benefits. While existing ethical frameworks offer valuable approaches to responsible innovation, their adoption in organizational settings remains limited. In this paper, we ask why such ethical frameworks are not adopted in digital innovation. We begin with empirical findings from semi-structured interviews with innovation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) leaders. They reveal barriers to adoption, such as individual limitations, organizational misalignment, and structural deficiencies. We discuss these findings in relation to the existing literature and propose recommendations for integrating ethics into practice from three perspectives: (1) the individual innovators, (2) their environment of organizational values, and (3) organizational structures. These recommendations address the epistemic, moral, and ethical requirements of the ethical innovator.","Corporate Innovation; Digital Responsibility; Innovation Ethics; Responsible Digital Innovation","","","Aldewereld, Huib, Design for values in software development, pp. 831-845, (2015); August, Hans Jürgen, CSR and Innovation: A Holistic Approach From a Business Perspective, CSR, Sustainability, Ethics and Governance, pp. 29-73, (2018); Designing Social Systems in A Changing World, (1996); Baumeister, Roy F., Role of self-control failure in immoral and unethical actions, Current Opinion in Psychology, 6, pp. 66-69, (2015); Baumeister, Roy F., Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 5, pp. 1252-1265, (1998); Moral Und Innovation in Organisationen, (2018); Verantwortung Prinzip Oder Problem, (1995); Blazovich, Janell L., Ethical corporate citizenship: Does it pay?, Research on Professional Responsibility and Ethics in Accounting, 15, pp. 127-163, (2011); undefined, (2008); Brunk, Katja H., Exploring origins of ethical company/brand perceptions - A consumer perspective of corporate ethics, Journal of Business Research, 63, 3, pp. 255-262, (2010)","","Routledge","23299460; 23299037","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000679272"

In a constantly evolving context, it is necessary to identify the entrepreneur’s responsibilities in managing and facilitating the flow of knowledge within the organization. Specifically, the literature on knowledge management does not extensively cover how it is possible to create and translate knowledge in companies operating in the hosting and cloud sector. Design/methodology/approach: We applied a qualitative study to analyse the entrepreneur’s key figure since a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the framework model applied to knowledge management and the hosting and cloud computing sector. We selected the Serverplan case study, a hosting and cloud provider that offers a solution of infrastructure as a service and gained a deep understanding of their unique digitalization and innovation dynamics. In March 2024, we collected data through a strategic sequence and timeline, beginning with two informal meetings. We then conducted a semi-structured interview in Italian only with Serverplan’s CEO to gain insights into specific aspects of the business. Findings: We identify four key factors essential to success: embracing continuous evolution, achieving a balance between standardization and flexibility, effectively managing tacit knowledge, fostering a strong corporate culture and employee engagement. The most crucial element of the process is the figure of the entrepreneur who improves the KT and the KC. The critical points of his work are direct contact with all the staff and external stakeholders, passion, direct and indirect self-assessment tests that allow continuous feedback and improvements and continuous updating to remain competitive in the dynamic environment. These elements found are those that make the case exemplary for the KT and KC processes in dynamic environments. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained from Serverplan can be extended and adapted to various business realities, regardless of industry. The importance of a knowledge-oriented culture, well-defined knowledge management processes and leadership committed to supporting continuous learning and innovation is universal. It can bring benefits in multiple business contexts. However, it is relevant to note that this study has some limitations. First, it analyses only one specific sector, and second, the methodology is based on a single case study due to the specific characteristics of the sector analysed. Practical implications: This study has important implications for both academics and managers. In the first perspective, it enriched the literature on knowledge management in dynamic contexts. By analysing the main findings of the case study and literature review, this study identifies relevant skills, procedures and initiatives to build a strong company. In the second perspective, the paper supports managers and organizations in improving their ability to build and maintain successful companies in a dynamic context through specific characteristics of entrepreneurs that enhance the KC and KT. It is very significant to obtain and maintain a long-term competitive advantage. Originality/value: The originality of the article lies in the fact that, although there are articles that have analysed knowledge management in the digital sector and the hosting and cloud computing sector, no article to date has applied the framework of Liyanage et al. (2009) to understand how to strengthen the knowledge creation and transfer process.","Digital Era; Dynamic Context; Entrepreneurs; Information Technology; Innovation; Knowledge Management","","","Andriole, Stephen J., Five myths about digital transformation, MIT Sloan Management Review, 58, 3, pp. 20-22, (2017); Alina, Signe B., Cloud Based Cross-system Integration for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, Procedia Computer Science, 104, pp. 127-132, (2016); Human Capital A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education, (1975); Birkel, Hendrik, Development of a risk framework for Industry 4.0 in the context of sustainability for established manufacturers, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 2, (2019); Bontis, Nick, The knowledge toolbox:: A review of the tools available to measure and manage intangible resources, European Management Journal, 17, 4, pp. 391-402, (1999); Caputo, Francesco, Building T-shaped professionals for mastering digital transformation, Journal of Business Research, 154, (2023); Carayannis, Elias George, An exploration of contemporary organizational artifacts and routines in a sustainable excellence context, Journal of Knowledge Management, 21, 1, pp. 35-56, (2017); Ciffolilli, Andrea, Industry 4.0: national and regional comparative advantages in key enabling technologies, European Planning Studies, 26, 12, pp. 2323-2343, (2018); Basics of Qualitative Research Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Correia, Silvia Regina Veronezi, Cloud computing projects: critical success factors, RAUSP Management Journal, 58, 1, pp. 5-21, (2023)","","Emerald Publishing","14601060","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000616438"

CSR enhances a company's reputation, attracts socially-conscious consumers, and boosts employee morale. Moreover, digital platforms amplify the impact of CSR initiatives, allowing businesses to engage with global communities. Despite extensive research on CSR in various contexts in the digital age, there is a notable gap in understanding its effects on organizational citizenship behavior and job satisfaction specifically within Vietnamese manufacturing firms. In such as context, this study examines the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and job satisfaction of employees in Vietnamese manufacturing firms in the digital age. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from employees working in manufacturing firms in Vietnam. After four months, we received 375 valid responses. Data was put into SPSS software for analysis. Our findings show that CSR towards the community does not have a significant relationship with employees' OCB, while CSR towards the government has a very low level of impact on employees' OCB. These findings suggest that not all CSR efforts are equally effective in fostering positive employee outcomes. Consequently, we propose targeted solutions to enhance CSR practices in Vietnamese firms to boost OCB and job satisfaction among employees, thereby contributing to both organizational performance and social well-being in the digital age.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Industry 4.0; Job Satisfaction; Manufacturing Sector; Organizational Citizenship Behavior; Job Satisfaction; Company Reputations; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Age; Digital Platforms; Employee Morale; Global Community; Manufacturing Firms; Manufacturing Sector; Organizational Citizenship Behaviors; Vietnamese; Smart Manufacturing","Job satisfaction; Company reputations; Corporate social responsibility; Digital age; Digital platforms; Employee morale; Global community; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing sector; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Vietnamese; Smart manufacturing","","Economy and Forecast Journal, (2010); Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, (1953); Business in Contemporary Society Framework and Issues, (1971); Academy of Management Journal, (1973); Academy of Management Review, (1979); Colorado College, (2009); Schönherr, Norma, Exploring the interface of CSR and the sustainable development goals, Transnational Corporations, 24, 3, pp. 33-47, (2017); International Journal of Management Accounting and Economics, (2015); European Commission Directorate General for Employment Social Affairs and Inclusion, (2014); Bianchi, Enrique Carlos, The impact of perceived CSR on corporate reputation and purchase intention, European Journal of Management and Business Economics, 28, 3, pp. 206-221, (2019)","Solina, V.; Longo, F.; Romero, D.","Elsevier B.V.","18770509","9781510849914","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000556570"

Negative corporate social responsibility can have direct impacts on corporate reputation. Choosing appropriate channels to publish the negative social responsibility information of enterprises in order to reduce the impact of these negative social events on corporate reputation is imperative for corporate image management. This research examines the differences in the impact of enterprise-generated content and -co-generated content on consumer attitudes using second-hand data analysis and then investigates how different information sources influence corporate reputation through empirical experiments. The results indicate that co-generated content performs better than other sources of information on corporate reputation, while professional user-generated content has the most negative impact. We further identify the external attribution as a mediation mechanism in the relationship between information sources and corporate reputation. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the research findings are discussed.","Attribution Of Responsibility; Corporate Reputation; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Information Sources","","This research was supported by grant from National Social Science Foundation of China (15BGL205).","Wang, Chenglu, Interactive Marketing is the New Normal, pp. 1-12, (2023); Gao, Li, The impact of artificial intelligence stimuli on customer engagement and value co-creation: the moderating role of customer ability readiness, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 317-333, (2023); Zadeh, Arash H., Predicting value cocreation behavior in social media via integrating uses and gratifications paradigm and theory of planned behavior, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 195-214, (2023); Nangpiire, Clement, Customer engagement and value co-creation/destruction: the internal fostering and hindering factors and actors in the tourist/hotel experience, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 16, 2, pp. 173-188, (2022); Dong, Xinyu, Negative online brand engagement: conceptualisation, scale development and validation, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 18, 5, pp. 787-814, (2024); Shao, Zhucheng, How the characteristics of social media influencers and live content influence consumers' impulsive buying in live streaming commerce?

In this vein, financial support is deemed an important facilitator of green innovation. Nonetheless, traditional financial institutions often restrict investment in such projects due to biases surrounding the returns of green projects and difficulties in risk assessment. The rise of digital inclusive finance offers new insights into addressing this challenge. Drawing on data from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2014 and 2019 and employing a multidimensional fixed-effect model, this paper systematically investigates the impact and mechanisms of action of digital inclusive finance on corporate green innovation. The study finds that digital inclusive finance significantly spurs green innovation within enterprises; this finding remains robust following a series of robustness checks and the addressing of endogeneity concerns. The facilitative effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and areas with stricter environmental regulations. Digital inclusive finance supports green innovation mainly through two pathways: ’funding effects,’ related to easing financing constraints and reducing transaction costs, and ’responsibility effects,’ pertaining to the enhancement of corporate social responsibility. Additionally, green innovation driven by digital inclusive finance further improves the quality of the ecological environment, leading to increased total factor productivity and overall corporate performance. This paper enriches the externalities research of digital inclusive finance, providing theoretical foundations and practical insights to foster the synergistic development of digital inclusive finance and green innovation.","Article; Compensation; Corporate Finance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Country Economic Status; Decision Making; Digital Inclusive Finance; Digitalization; Economic Development; Environmental Protection; Environmental Sustainability; Financial Management; Government; Green Innovation; Human; Investment; Patent; Public Health; Responsibility; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomics; Systematic Review; Theoretical Model; China; Economics; Invention; Procedures; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Humans; Inventions; Investments","Article; compensation; corporate finance; corporate social responsibility; country economic status; decision making; digital inclusive finance; digitalization; economic development; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; financial management; government; green innovation; human; investment; patent; public health; responsibility; risk assessment; socioeconomics; systematic review; theoretical model; China; economics; invention; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Inventions; Investments","","Financial Economics Research, (2022); Kapoor, Aditi, Financial inclusion and the future of the Indian economy, Futures, 56, pp. 35-42, (2014); Finance Economics, (2017); Allen, Franklin, The foundations of financial inclusion: Understanding ownership and use of formal accounts, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 27, pp. 1-30, (2016); International Journal of Education and Management, (2019); China Economic Quarterly, (2018); Forum on Science and Technology in China, (2018); South Finance, (2022); Southwest Finance, (2022); Bus Econ Res, (2022)","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","39715192","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213399904"

The review is based both on bibliometric and content analyses in order to map current knowledge on these two theoretical constructs. By collecting and comparing definitions and key topics, the review revealed that DS and CDR are treated separately in the current literature, missing their potential synergies—DS often overlooks ethical implications, while CDR neglects broader sustainability impacts. However, notable convergences emerged, leading to the development of an integrated Corporate Digital Sustainability (CDS) framework. This framework leverages digital technologies as a cross-cutting enabler and systematizes values, objectives, dimensions, practices, and aspects to guide corporations in navigating the complexities of digital sustainability while achieving responsible digital progress. The study concludes by proposing a research agenda to guide future explorations in this promising direction.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Digital Sustainability; Digital Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Systematic Literature Review; Sustainable Development Goals; 'current; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Digital Sustainability; Corporates; Digital Sustainability; Dual Track; Scholarly Works; Systematic Literature Review; Web Of Science; Corporate Strategy; Industrial Development; Industrial Technology; Knowledge; Literature Review; Sustainable Development; Theoretical Study","Sustainable development goals; 'current; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporate digital sustainability; Corporates; Digital sustainability; Dual track; Scholarly works; Systematic literature review; Web of Science; corporate strategy; industrial development; industrial technology; knowledge; literature review; sustainable development; theoretical study","","Digital with Purpose Delivering A Smarter2030, (2019); Bohnsack, RenÃ©, Sustainability in the digital age: Intended and unintended consequences of digital technologies for sustainable development, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 2, pp. 599-602, (2022); Fan, Mingyue, Digital technology application and enterprise competitiveness: the mediating role of ESG performance and green technology innovation, Environment, Development and Sustainability, (2023); Zhang, Yixiang, Can digital technology application promote energy saving and emission reduction practices in enterprise?

We develop a composite CSR indicator and analyze its association with regional R&D + i investment across Spain. Findings indicate that STI adoption, particularly in precision agriculture and smart livestock management, significantly enhances CSR outcomes by optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. However, notable regional disparities emerge, influenced by economic resources, infrastructure, and policy environments. This study contributes to the literature by elucidating the role of STI in fostering sustainable agricultural practices and underscores the necessity for targeted policy interventions to support regions lagging in CSR performance.

To this end, data collected from 224 SME managers/owners in Yemen were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM-PLS) via SmartPLS. The results indicate that CSR significantly enhances GI among manufacturing SMEs. Furthermore, DT not only has a direct positive effect on GI but also moderates the relationship between CSR and GI, amplifying the impact of CSR practices. This suggests that DT acts as a catalyst, strengthening the effects of CSR on GI. These results are expected to enlighten managers of manufacturing SMEs in least-developed countries on the importance of integrating CSR with DT strategies to improve GI capabilities. Therefore, policymakers should support this integration to foster sustainable development and enhance SMEs’ performance. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature by combining CSR and DT within a framework that elucidates their interaction and impact on GI.

This exploration is crucial given the persistent pressures driving companies to engage in greenwashing practices for legitimacy. Aiming to shed light on the function of AI in reducing the prevalence of greenwashing by Chinese businesses, the findings, derived from panel data estimation of Chinese A-share firms, suggest that the implementation of AI has a positive impact on the fight against greenwashing. The investigation presents compelling evidence that greenwashing mechanism control can be accelerated by AI technologies. Organizations that invest strategically in artificial intelligence exhibit a diminished propensity to obfuscate environmental performance by means of AI-enabled automation and enhanced data-driven decision-making. Intriguingly, the study demonstrates that the substantial disparate greenwashing impact of AI depends on ownership structure. In comparison to non-SOEs, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) demonstrate diminished AI control over greenwashing. Significantly, the research utilizes a variety of validation methods, such as instrumental variable approach, propensity score matching, and two-stage least squares, to ensure the validity of the primary findings.","Artificial Intelligence; China; Environment; Greenwashing; Soes; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Competitiveness; Corporate Social Responsibility; State Owned Enterprise; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; China","artificial intelligence; automation; competitiveness; corporate social responsibility; state owned enterprise; sustainability; sustainable development; China","","Abbasi, Sina, Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain Networks’ Response to Various Carbon Policies during COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 4, (2023); Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth, (2017); Ahmad, Tanveer, Energetics Systems and artificial intelligence: Applications of industry 4.0, Energy Reports, 8, pp. 334-361, (2022); Ahmadova, Gozal, Too good to be true: The inverted U-shaped relationship between home-country digitalization and environmental performance, Ecological Economics, 196, (2022); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2020); Gull, Ammar Ali, Walking the Talk?

Platform workers often suffer poor working conditions. Most platform companies treat crowd and gig workers as self-employed or independent contractors and, thus, normally protective labour laws do not apply. In response, initiatives have been taken through case law and legislation to extend the reach of the traditional employmentship to platform work. For example, the German Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) reclassified and treated platform workers as employees in high-profile rulings, which are discussed in more detail below. The recently adopted EU Directive on Platform Work enshrines a legal presumption of employment for platform workers. Regulations have also recently been introduced in EU Member States that subsume platform workers under the concept of employee. However, as argued in this article, legal and judicial initiatives aimed at extending the employee status often have limits given the market dynamics and de facto adaptation and circumvention strategies used by platform businesses. Moreover, traditional labour law protection does not always seem to be suitable for tackling the complexities and peculiarities of the various types of platforms. The following theses therefore seem worth discussing: 1. Extending employee status to platform work appears promising if this is already anchored in the socio-economic reality and if a consensus can be reached between the social partners in this regard. An existing example is the Spanish riders’ law, which pursues a sectoral approach and was supported not only by trade union organisations but also by employers’ associations. 2. In addition, the creation of a substantial core of social rights for platform workers, irrespective of employment status, should be strongly focused and legally brought forward. The long-standing scholarly discussion about alternative regulatory approaches to forms of work in the legal grey area between dependent employment and self-employment should be revived and made fruitful for the new phenomenon of digital work platforms. 3. Thirdly, self-regulatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives by platform companies to improve working conditions should be encouraged by legislators and policymakers. As will be shown later in this article, a wide range of CSR efforts by the platforms already exist. In order to counter the risk of window dressing, the platform business operators’ own initiatives should be made effective through appropriate flanking legal measures and public pressure.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Fair Working Conditions; Labour Standards For The Self-employed; Platform Work; Traditional Employment Relationship","","The author is a co-principal investigator of the research project \u2018Platform work and data protection nationally and internationally\u2019 funded by the Hans B\u00F6ckler Foundation.","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","20319525; 23995556","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196274465"

The objective of the current research is to examine the role that corporate social responsibility in technological innovation plays in enhancing the sustainable competitive performance of firms. The idea that digital transformation mediates the relationship between corporate social responsibility in technological innovation and sustainable competitive performance is proposed in this study. Additionally, the mastery climate may act as a boundary condition that strengthens the positive relationship between CSR and digital transformation. The data were collected in Chinese firms through a questionnaire. The results supported the mediation and moderation hypotheses, confirming that digital transformation mediates the relationship between corporate social responsibility in technological innovation and sustainable competitive performance. The mastery climate moderates the relationship between corporate social responsibility in technological innovation and digital transformation. The results have implications for theory and practice.

However, simultaneously, they encounter challenges linked to inadequate risk management and insufficient focus on social responsibility. However, the discussions surrounding these matters have primarily been confined to case studies, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that give rise to social responsibility risks. This research addresses this gap by establishing a database of corporate social responsibility risks for Internet platform companies and employs a qualitative comparative analysis method to dissect these social responsibility risks. The study unveils that Internet platform companies can navigate low social responsibility risks through three distinct pathways: the “resource-experience combining type,” the “long-term shareholder-orientation type,” and the “novel innovative advantage type.” It delves into the questions of what Internet platform companies should do and how they should approach corporate social responsibility in varying contexts. Furthermore, it identifies novel strategies within the domain of platform organizations and the platform economy, thus expanding the conceptual framework of corporate social responsibility driving mechanisms. This research offers valuable guidance for government policy development directed at fostering the sustainable growth of Internet platforms. Additionally, it provides platform companies with insights into optimizing their approaches to manage social responsibility risks in alignment with their unique characteristics.

Unlike human rights, IHL does not grant individuals direct rights, but modifies individual rights, like the right to life, during armed conflict. Key principles of IHL include distinction and proportionality to limit civilian casualties. However, IHL lacks effective enforcement mechanisms. Public interest litigation offers a potential avenue for enforcing IHL through individual rights-based approaches with the potential to impact domestic and international law. Recent public interest cases range from climate change, digital rights, and corporate responsibility to refugee and human rights cases, often incorporating international law arguments. Resorting to (international) criminal law in the case of war crimes is an established public interest approach. Yet, recently, public interest litigation alleging violations of IHL before administrative, constitutional, and human rights courts has established itself as a novel approach. Scrutinizing such landmark decisions, particularly those involving IHL, provides insights into the approaches and potentials of public interest litigation. This contribution analyzes examples of public interest litigation seeking compliance with IHL in arms export, drone strike and air strike cases to illustrate the procedural avenues, legal arguments, and socio-political implications. The analysis offers a critical evaluation of the potential and challenges of public interest litigation in shaping domestic and international law and practice, especially concerning IHL.","Access To Justice; Armed Conflict; Enforcement Of Ihl; Fundamental Rights; German Case Law; Individual Rights; International Humanitarian Law; Public Interest Litigation; Strategic Litigation","","Funding text 1: The first lawsuit, submitted on 5 April 2024, represented three Palestinian homeless individuals in Rafah, Gaza. It called for an immediate halt to future approvals and the revocation of existing approvals of weapon deliveries to Israel, citing violations of international law. The duty of the German government to protect the right to life of the plaintiffs was argued as the legal basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The lawsuit was filed by seven lawyers from Berlin and supported by the European Legal Support Center (ELSC), the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy (PIPD), Law for Palestine, the Justice and Accountability for Palestine Initiative, and Forensis. According to the plaintiffs, there would be evidence suggesting that the delivered arms are being utilized by the Israeli military for serious breaches of international law, including genocide and war crimes. The lawsuit argued that the arms supplies to Israel, approved by the German government, contravened the obligations under the German War Weapons Control Act (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz).; Funding text 2: In March 2021, the plaintiffs filed a constitutional complaint against this decision before the German Constitutional Court. They alleged a violation of their right to life under Article 2(2)1 of the German Basic Law by the overly restrictive requirements for the existence and the violation of a duty to protect. At this point in time, the case is still pending before the Constitutional Court. It is to be hoped that the Constitutional Court will affirm the possibility of a duty of protection for foreign citizens abroad and will reject the problematic requirements imposed by the Federal Administrative Court. The case is part of the public interest litigation of the ECCHR in cases of US drone strikes in the context of the so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019 and European countries\u2019 involvement therein.

To assess the effectiveness of a three-month corporate health program (CHP) at the workplace that utilized digital tools for implementation. Materials and methods. The study involved 22 employees of an IT company in Ukraine. The CHP was developed and implemented using a digital tool with a special algorithm for collecting, processing, and sharing information within the CHP. For further implementation, a chatbot with an intuitive interface was constructed, which allowed a personalized access to the account for each CHP participant. It has become possible to obtain personalized information regarding changes in CHP participation and to provide personalized recommendations. The CHP plan also included educational events on healthy lifestyles, accompanied by interactive materials in the chatbot. The CHP’s effectiveness was assessed based on the results of the survey using standardized scales of the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile Questionnaire (HPLP-II) before and after CHP implementation. Results. The overall score of the Healthy Lifestyle Profile increased significantly (from 52.9 % to 57.9 %, p=0.025), the same as the individual scales of Health Responsibility (from 38.4 % to 48.8 %, p=0.00621) and Stress Management (from 45.1 % to 55.3 %, p=0.00104) before and after CHP implementation. Although positive changes were observed in the Physical Activity, Nutrition, Spiritual Growth, and Interpersonal Relationships scales, they did not reach statistical significance. The survey participants’ responses to individual questions suggest that their behavior has undergone positive changes. Specifically, respondents are opting for lower-fat and sugar foods, visiting their doctor regularly, eating healthy foods, taking care of their own mental health, and effectively managing their workload. Conclusions. The CHP, which utilized digital tools, had a positive impact on the development of healthy habits and practices among participants. As evidenced by the data collected, the CHP increased participants’ sense of responsibility for their own health and stress management skills. These findings suggest that implementing similar programs using digital tools is feasible.","Corporate Program; Digital Health; Health Informatics; Public Health; Workplace Health","","","World Health Organization, (2006); undefined; Kumar, Sanjiv, Health promotion: An effective tool for global health, Indian Journal of Community Medicine, 37, 1, pp. 5-12, (2012); Healthy Diet, (2015); World Mental Health Report Transforming Mental Health for all; undefined; Digital Health; Classification of Digital Interventions Services and Applications in Health A Shared Language to Describe the Uses of Digital Technology for Health, (2020); Ajayi, Kobi V., The Use of Digital Health Tools for Health Promotion Among Women With and Without Chronic Diseases: Insights From the 2017-2020 Health Information National Trends Survey, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 10, 8, (2022); Qscience Connect, (2022)","","State Institution of Science ""Research and Practical Center of Preventive and Clinical Medicine"" State Administration Department","26164868","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214251935"

In addition, a whole philosophy of nonfinancial disclosure has recently been developing and has become a priority for organizations seeking to be transparent and accountable. While some companies have already adopted this approach, practices related to information transparency in corporate digital responsibility are still in their early stages, creating a need to improve reporting and promote greater understanding in this evolving field. Based on a study analyzing the disclosure of information on digitization and taking into account that the board of directors is the body in charge of companies’ disclosure policy, the study aims to identify the factors that favor this disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: As established by Ponce et al. (2022), IBEX-35 companies are Public Interest Companies subject to European and international regulations and are required to provide information on economic efficiency indicators and nonfinancial indicators. In relation to the proposed objectives, the aim is to analyze the possible factors that condition the degree of dissemination of information on digitization. To this end, a multiple linear regression of the dissemination index has been proposed following the works of Gil et al. (2018), Rodríguez-Ariza et al. (2014) and Briano-Turrent & Rodríguez-Ariza (2013). The estimation will be performed using the SPSS software (version 27). Findings: The results show that the number of independent directors has a positive influence on the level of information disclosed by companies online. Conversely – and in line with previous studies – board size does not have a significant impact on the level of information transparency. Research limitations/implications: This study has a few limitations that adversely impact the generalizability of the results. First, the subjective problem inherent in the rating and evaluation of information collected in the annual reports of sample companies cannot be excluded. Second, the consideration that each element that constitutes the IDT has the same weight, there being no weighting criteria. Finally, the study population is limited to 35 listed companies, not considering medium and small companies. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the results are sufficiently interesting to justify and extend the research to a larger number of companies and, of course, to other stock market indices. Another interesting future line of research would be to include more independent variables to analyze what other factors determine the degree of digital transparency of companies. Practical implications: The study may be useful for organizations to take into account when identifying the corporate governance characteristics that will improve the disclosure of information on digitalization, which is still incipient and voluntary. Similar considerations could be made with respect to the competent authorities in regulating the disclosure of information by companies, insofar as they should promote policies that, in general, favor corporate transparency. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in three main ways: 1) although there is a large body of research that has explored the impact of corporate governance dimensions on the level of nonfinancial transparency, the present study pioneers the approach to digitalization disclosure in Spanish listed companies; 2) it provides evidence that it is highly advisable to have a majority of independent directors to achieve a higher degree of digital disclosure; and 3) the results of this research show the current state of digital transparency on the websites of most of the listed companies in Spain, which could serve as a benchmark for those responsible for issuing corporate governance policies and guidelines.","Determinants; Digitalization; Directors; Disclosure; Ibex35; Nonfinancial Information","","","Revista Aeca Asociacion Espanola De Contabilidad Y Administracion De Empresas, (2012); Achim, Monica Violeta, The impact of corporate governance on the digitalization process: empirical evidence for the Romanian companies, Digital Finance, 4, 4, pp. 313-340, (2022); Politicas De Impulso A Las Industrias Audiovisuales, (2015); Alonso-Almeida, Maria del Mar, Transparency of businesses on the internet for shareholder and investor confidence: An empirical analysis, Cuadernos de Administracion, 22, 38, pp. 11-30, (2009); Informacao Sociedade, (2024); Baalouch, Fatma, A study of the determinants of environmental disclosure quality: evidence from French listed companies, Journal of Management and Governance, 23, 4, pp. 939-971, (2019); International Journal of Good Conscience, (2014); Journal of Corporation Law, (2002); Bonsón, Enrique, Voluntary, disclose of financial reporting on internet.

Design/methodology/approach: This study measures the audit digitalization (AD) index by textual analysis method and matches the provincial AD index with the Chinese listed firm’s data from 2011 to 2019. The two-way fixed effect regression is used to explore the nexus of audit digitalization and corporate green innovation. Findings: The empirical results demonstrate that government audit digitalization stimulates corporate green innovation, especially for substantive green innovation. Research and development expenditures on personnel and capital are influential mediators and are increased by audit digitalization. The heterogeneity analysis indicates the anti-driving effect for fewer audit informatization expenditures or lower environmental audit coverage, and the incentive effect for state-owned enterprises or firms with corporate social responsibility reports. Originality/value: The incremental contribution lies in recognizing the progress of government audit digitalization and its role from digital to environmental governance, which extends digital capabilities and digital expertise into the government audit view. Based on textual analysis, a reliable dictionary of audit digitalization is built by machine-learning methods. Then, the authors confirm the effectiveness of audit digitalization, especially when other forms of digitalization fail to promote substantive green innovation. This study also attests to the anti-driving and incentive effect from the external governance perspective. The authors’ findings have implications for digital ecological civilization.","Audit Digitalization (ad); Government Auditing; Green Innovation (gp); R&d Investment; Textual Analysis","","This work was supported by National Key Research Projects of Accounting (No. 2023KJA3-12).","Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Ashraf, Musaib, The impact of audit committee information technology expertise on the reliability and timeliness of financial reporting, Accounting Review, 95, 5, pp. 23-56, (2019); Barr-Pulliam, Dereck, The effects of person-specific, task, and environmental factors on digital transformation and innovation in auditing: A review of the literature, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 33, 2, pp. 337-374, (2022); Bianchi, Pietro A., Auditors’ Joint Engagements and Audit Quality: Evidence from Italian Private Companies, Contemporary Accounting Research, 35, 3, pp. 1533-1577, (2018); Blei, David M., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Campr, Michal, Comparing semantic models for evaluating automatic document summarization, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9302, pp. 252-260, (2015); Chen, Wen, How does digitization enable green innovation?

Department of Commerce and Management, Hans Raj Mahila Maha Vidyalaya, Jalandhar, India","Purpose: This study aims to determine experimentally factors affecting the satisfaction of retail stock investors with various investor protection regulatory measures implemented by the Government of India and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Also, an effort has been made to gauge the level of satisfaction of retail equities investors with the laws and guidelines developed by the Indian Government and SEBI for their invested funds. Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish the study’s goals, a well-structured questionnaire was created with the help of a literature review, and copies of it were filled by Punjabi retail equities investors with the aid of stockbrokers, i.e. intermediaries. Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Mohali-area intermediaries were chosen using a random selection procedure. Xerox copies of the questionnaire were given to the intermediaries, who were then asked to collect responses from their clients. Some intermediaries requested the researcher to sit in their offices to collect responses from their clients. Only 373 questionnaires out of 1,000 questionnaires that were provided had been received back. Only 328 copies were correctly filled by the equity investors. To conduct the analysis, 328 copies, which were fully completed, were used as data. The appropriate approaches, such as descriptives, factor analysis and ordinal regression analysis, were used to study the data. Findings: With the aid of factor analysis, four factors have been identified that influence investors’ satisfaction with various investor protection regulatory measures implemented by government and SEBI regulations, including regulations addressing primary and secondary market dealings, rules for investor awareness and protection, rules to prevent company malpractices and laws for corporate governance and investor protection. The impact of these four components on investor satisfaction has been investigated using ordinal regression analysis. The pseudo-R-square statistics for the ordinal regression model demonstrated the model’s capacity for the explanation. The findings suggested that a significant amount of the overall satisfaction score about the various investor protection measures implemented by the government/SEBI has been explained by the regression model. Research limitations/implications: A study could be conducted to analyse the perspective of various stakeholders towards the disclosures made and norms followed by corporate houses. The current study may be expanded to cover the entire nation because it is only at the state level currently. It might be conceivable to examine how investments made in the retail capital market affect investors in rural areas. The influence of reforms on the functioning of stock markets could potentially be examined through another study. It could be possible to undertake a study on female investors’ knowledge about retail investment trends. The effect of digital stock trading could be examined in India. The effect of technological innovations on capital markets can be studied. Practical implications: This research would be extremely useful to regulators in developing policies to protect retail equities investors. Investors are required to be safeguarded and protected to deal freely in the securities market, so they should be given more freedom in terms of investor protection measures. Stock exchanges should have the potential to bring about technological advancements in trading to protect investors from any kind of financial loss. Since the government has the power to create rules and regulations to strengthen investor protection. So, this research will be extremely useful to the government. Social implications: This work has societal ramifications. Because when adequate rules and regulations are in place to safeguard investors, they will be able to invest freely. Companies will use capital wisely and profitably. Companies should undertake tasks towards corporate social responsibility out of profits because corporate houses are part and parcel of society only. Originality/value: Many investors may lack the necessary expertise to make sound financial judgments. They might not be aware of the entire risk-reward profile of various investment options. However, they must know various investor protection measures taken by the Government of India & Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to safeguard their interests. Investors must be well-informed on the precautions to take while dealing with market intermediaries, as well as in the stock market.","Companies Act; Compliance And Legitimacy; Information Disclosure; Shareholders Rights","","","Aarp Foundation National Fraud Victim Study, (2011); Emory Corporate Governance and Accountability Review, (2014); Consumer Fraud in the United States an Ftc Survey, (2004); Business and Economic History, (1998); Arth Prabandh A Journal of Economics and Management, (2012); South Asian Law Review Journal, (2019); Balleisen, Edward J., Fraud: An American History from Barnum to Madoff, pp. 1-480, (2017); Barber, Brad M., Boys will be boys: Gender, overconfidence, and common stock investment, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116, 1, pp. 261-292, (2001); Bennedsen, Morten, The balance of power in closely held corporations, Journal of Financial Economics, 58, 1-2, pp. 113-139, (2000); A Study on Investors Perception Towards Online Stock Trading, (2017)","","Emerald Publishing","1754243X; 17542448","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188308015"

This article first explores the theoretical and conceptual foundations of digital transformation and CSR. A mixed methods approach is then used, combining qualitative interviews with a wider quantitative survey, to investigate how digital innovations influence CSR practices. Interview analysis provides the basis for the development of a conceptual framework and eight hypotheses, which are then tested using quantitative techniques to analyze survey data. The results reveal several links between the benefits of digitalization and CSR. Claims management platforms, digital roadside assistance tools, and digital vehicle assessment and inspection all positively impact policyholders’ well-being in terms of compensation and asset preservation, thereby enhancing the CSR profile of automobile insurers. Similarly, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) training and simulation, as well as repair assistance, have positive impacts on policyholders’ well-being and advance the CSR positioning of automobile insurers. This article has limitations as it is based on a narrow industrial sector in a single country, but it nonetheless highlights certain relevant interrelationships between digitalization and CSR, contributing to the development of theory and practice in these research areas.","Automobile Insurance Sector; Claims Management; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Digital Technologies; Digitalization","","","Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics, (2007); Research in Higher Education Journal, (2015); Ahmad, Maqsood, Intellectual capital, corporate social responsibility and sustainable competitive performance of small and medium-sized enterprises: mediating effects of organizational innovation, Kybernetes, 52, 10, pp. 4014-4040, (2023); Ahmad, Maqsood, Does CSR digitalization improve the sustainable competitive performance of SMEs?

This study focuses on understanding the factors influencing tax avoidance behaviors among SMEs in Greece’s tourism sector, a sector that has received limited research attention. To this end, a quantitative cross-sectional design was employed, using a structured questionnaire to explore potential factors influencing tax avoidance behavior. Data were collected from 534 SME managers and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess the impact of key factors and their interrelationships, including coercive power, digital transformation, tax knowledge, firm performance, and perceived fairness, on tax avoidance. In addition, corporate social responsibility (CSR) was included as a moderator variable, while coercive power and digital transformation were assessed as mediators. Furthermore, Multi-Group Analysis (MGA) was conducted to explore the differences between small and medium enterprises, as well as different ownership structures. The results indicate that all key determinants, except perceived fairness, are significantly and positively related to tax avoidance intention. Additionally, it was revealed that coercive power increases tax avoidance through firm performance and tax knowledge, while digital transformation mediates the influence of firm performance on tax avoidance by curtailing avoidance intentions. While CSR mitigates the negative influence of coercive power, digital transformation has a dual role: that of promoting transparency and strategic efforts to reduce the tax burden. These findings have important policy implications, as policymakers seek to promote digital adoption and enhance CSR engagement while formulating specific regulatory strategies to reduce tax avoidance among SMEs.","Coercive Power; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Multi-group Analysis (mga); Risk Detection; Smes; Structural Equation Modeling; Tax Avoidance; Tourism Sector; Corporate Social Responsibility; Ecotourism; Industrial Policy; Ownership; Policy Making; Risk Assessment; Structural Analysis; Tax System; Transformation; Transparency","corporate social responsibility; ecotourism; industrial policy; ownership; policy making; risk assessment; structural analysis; tax system; transformation; transparency","","Tax Evasion Tax Avoidance and Development Finance, (2005); Fuadah, Luk Luk, The Relationship between Sustainability Reporting, E-Commerce, Firm Performance and Tax Avoidance with Organizational Culture as Moderating Variable in Small and Medium Enterprises in Palembang, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 7, (2022); Tax Evasion Tax Avoidance and Tax Expenditures in Developing Countries A Review of the Literature, (2009); Sains Humanika, (2014); Li, Yan, Tax Avoidance Culture and Employees' Behavior Affect Sustainable Business Performance: The Moderating Role of Corporate Social Responsibility, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 10, (2022); Viena Ak, (2015); Draining Development Controlling Flows of Illicit Funds from Developing Countries, (2012); Kayaoglu, Aysegul, Explaining Tax Non-Compliance from a Neo-Institutionalist Perspective: Some Lessons from a Public Opinion Survey in Turkey, Sosyoekonomi, 28, 43, pp. 89-105, (2020); Durán-Román, José Luis, Taxation of tourism activities: A review of the top 50 tourism destinations, Revista de Economia Mundial, 2020, 55, pp. 49-78, (2020); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208569259"

This evolving context has shaped the current business landscape, which increasingly demands socio-environmental accountability from firms. This paper addresses these emerging business requirements, making an original contribution to its field by drawing on stakeholder and signaling theories to identify whether the adoption of supply chain risk identification practices exerts a positive effect upon firms’ social performance. Additionally, it assesses the role of digital technology in strengthening this relationship. A survey of manufacturing firms was conducted to gather data, which was analyzed via covariance-based structural equation modeling and AMOS 28.0 software. The research found that practices intended to identify supply chain risks make a considerable contribution towards signaling a positive social sustainability reputation and highlighting the application of digital technology to help attain better social performance. Stakeholder saliency is an aspect that still requires further research.","Cleaner Production Practices; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Sustainability; Digital Transformation; Supply Chains; Cleaner Production; Cleaner Production Practice; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate-sustainability; Digital Transformation; Production Practice; Risk Identification; Social Performance; Social Sustainability; Supply-chain Risks","Cleaner production; Cleaner production practice; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate-sustainability; Digital transformation; Production practice; Risk Identification; Social performance; Social sustainability; Supply-chain risks","Hypothesis testing was conducted following the guidelines provided by Byrne (2016) and Kline (2023).

Despite growing interest in both fields of academia and practice, there remains scope for further empirical work at their intersection. This article, therefore, contributes to the extant literature on BHR and B4P by empirically exploring the case of Microsoft, an American MNE, and its corporate diplomacy activities on digital peace in cyberspace. Specifically, the case focuses on three purposefully selected initiatives: (1) the company's corporate diplomacy efforts on the Digital Geneva Convention, (2) the Digital Peace Now campaign, and (3) its proactive engagement in response to the war in Ukraine. These initiatives highlight how responsibility, leadership, employee empowerment, and partnerships have contributed to Microsoft's corporate culture and decision-making processes to create an environment that prioritizes digital peace and integrates both BHR and B4P perspectives. In doing so, this article argues for the importance of addressing B4P activities in tandem with BHR in a complementary manner within practitioner initiatives.","Business And Human Rights (bhr); Business For Peace (b4p); Corporate Diplomacy; Digital Peace; Polycentrism","","","Brenkert, George G., Business Ethics and Human Rights: An Overview, Business and Human Rights Journal, 1, 2, pp. 277-306, (2016); Buhmann, Karin, Neglecting the Proactive Aspect of Human Rights Due Diligence?

Using the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) method combined with the theory of industrial clusters, the contribution of digital technology application, green supply chain management, consumer behaviour, and corporate social responsibility to synergistic development is analyzed. It is found that the highly clustered wholesale and retail industry has promoted supply chain intelligence and logistics optimization through the extensive application of digital technology, creating favourable conditions for synergistic development. Regarding green supply chain management, cluster companies are more inclined to adopt green measures such as environmentally friendly packaging and energy-efficient logistics, effectively reducing carbon emission levels. In terms of consumer behaviour, the increase in the clustering rate has prompted consumers to be more inclined to consume green and purchase green products, thus promoting the decarbonization of products and services. CSR practices show that highly clustered companies are more active in implementing emission reduction measures, reflecting their responsibility for sustainable development. This study provides a new theoretical perspective for understanding the intrinsic mechanism of industrial clusters in carbon emission reduction and offers feasible carbon reduction strategies for industrial practices. In the urgent global carbon emission reduction context, this study provides essential academic and practical value for promoting China's wholesale and retail industry toward more sustainable development.","Carbon Emission Reduction; Csr Practices; Digital Technology Adoption; Synergistic Development; Carbon Emission; Cluster Analysis; Empowerment; Retailing; Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Development; Technological Development; China","carbon emission; cluster analysis; empowerment; retailing; supply chain management; sustainable development; technological development; China","Based on the conclusions above, promoting the green and low-carbon cooperative development of digital clusters in China's wholesale and retail industry, alongside bolstering digital technology innovation, is essential for achieving green and low-carbon goals. Enterprises should actively innovate in applying digital technologies to advance supply chain intelligence, e-commerce, and other digital tools, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of green and low-carbon cooperation. The continuous introduction of advanced supply chain intelligence technologies enables enterprises to manage production, logistics, and inventory effectively. Initiatives such as IoT technology, extensive data analysis, real-time monitoring, and intelligent supply chain scheduling can reduce resource waste and enhance operational efficiency. Digital supply chain management empowers enterprises to better respond to market demand changes, providing more accurate data support for green and low-carbon cooperation.Promoting the development of e-commerce is also a pivotal direction for digital technology innovation. Through e-commerce platforms, enterprises can directly and efficiently interact with consumers, offering personalized services and product recommendations. The digital nature of e-commerce facilitates conveying product life cycle and environmental protection information to consumers, encouraging them to choose green and low-carbon products. Innovations in digital technology also encompass the application of new tools, such as blockchain technology, to enhance the transparency and traceability of the supply chain. Through blockchain technology, enterprises can track the entire production, transport, and sales process, ensuring effective communication and verification of products' environmental attributes, thereby enhancing consumers' trust in the sustainability of products.Qinghai Minzu University: (NO:001)Outstanding Achievements of the Fifth Dr Tianqing Forum Funding for Achievements Qinghai Minzu University.Qinghai Minzu University: (NO:39D2023004)Study on the practical path of promoting green, low-carbon and circular development in Qinghai Province.Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students: (2022BKYZ029)The linkage of technology-organization-environment condition Configuration on the construction of low carbon city in China's development performance.","Ang, Rui, The relationship between CSR and financial performance and the moderating effect of ownership structure: Evidence from Chinese heavily polluting listed enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 30, pp. 117-129, (2022); Blichfeldt, Henrik, Performance effects of digital technology adoption and product & service innovation – A process-industry perspective, Technovation, 105, (2021); Boubaker, Sabri, Does corporate social responsibility reduce financial distress risk?, Economic Modelling, 91, pp. 835-851, (2020); Bressanelli, Gianmarco, Exploring how usage-focused business models enable circular economy through digital technologies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 3, (2018); Canadeo, Angela M., A Multi-disciplinary Approach to Managing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Patients on Oral Anticancer Therapy at a Large Academic Medical Center, Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports, 16, 6, pp. 509-516, (2021); Cao, Jie, Peer effects of corporate social responsibility, Management Science, 65, 12, pp. 5487-5503, (2019); Chan, Justine Tin Nok, Point-of-care testing in private pharmacy and drug retail settings: a narrative review, BMC Infectious Diseases, 23, 1, (2023); Cicea, Claudiu, Multi-Channel and Omni-Channel Retailing in the Scientific Literature: A Text Mining Approach, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 18, 1, pp. 19-36, (2023); Das, Manish, Bandwagon vs snob luxuries: Targeting consumers based on uniqueness dominance, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 61, (2021); de Roeck, Kenneth, Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethical Leadership: Investigating Their Interactive Effect on Employees’ Socially Responsible Behaviors, Journal of Business Ethics, 151, 4, pp. 923-939, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","09696989","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199203891"

Utilizing a normative legal methodology, the study analyzes relevant legal principles and doctrines, particularly focusing on Law No. 8 of 1999 on Consumer Protection and the Civil Code. The key findings of the study are twofold. First, it identifies that corporate entities bear responsibility for consumer losses under both the Consumer Protection Law and the ITE Law, which provides a legal structure for resolving disputes related to electronic transactions. However, the research also reveals a critical distinction: disputes arising from online purchases generally fall under the ITE Law, rather than the Consumer Protection Law. Second, the study highlights the challenge of interpreting the term ""consumer within the Consumer Protection Law, which explicitly refers to the final beneficiary of a product or service. This definition creates ambiguity in cases involving intermediaries or non-end consumers in online transactions. The study's contribution lies in its identification of a legal gap in the current regulatory framework. It suggests that the Consumer Protection Law may require revision to better address the complexities of modern e-commerce, particularly in distinguishing between end consumers and non-end consumers. By doing so, the research provides a foundation for future legal reforms aimed at improving the protection of consumers in the digital marketplace.","Consumer Protection Law; Dispute Resolution; Electronic Information And Transaction Law; Electronic Transaction","","","Primagraha Law Review, (2023); Expert Systems; Ariansyah, Kasmad, Drivers of and barriers to e-commerce adoption in Indonesia: Individuals’ perspectives and the implications, Telecommunications Policy, 45, 8, (2021); De Lega Lata Jurnal Llmu Hukum, (2022); Jurnal Hukum Dan Peradilan, (2020); Indonesian Journal of Islamic Jurisprudence Economic and Legal Theory, (2023); Buku Ajar Problematika Pelaksanaan Penyelesaian Gugatan Sederhana Guna Mengurangi Penumpukkan Perkara Perdata, (2020); Barkatullah, Abdul Halim, Does self-regulation provide legal protection and security to e-commerce consumers?, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 30, pp. 94-101, (2018); Purchasing and Supply Management, (2007); International Journal of Social Science Research and Review, (2023)","","Universitas Negeri Semarang","27150941; 27150968","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212288281"

Drawing on signaling theory, this study distinguishes between two country-level media environments − digital media accessibility and media freedom − of which the prior research has often implied their value in cultivating the stakeholders’ awareness about the firms’ socially responsible behavior, suggesting that they amplify the benefits of CSR actions. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts multilevel analysis with a sample of 44,222 firm-year observations representing 6,726 companies from 57 countries over the period 2003–2019. Findings: This study finds supportive evidence that CSR is more positively related to financial gains in countries with greater digital media accessibility. This study concludes that digital media accessibility affects a firm’s reputation and legitimacy benefits derived from CSR actions, resulting in better financial performance (FP). Originality/value: The findings of this paper contribute to the existing literature on the CSR–FP relationship by demonstrating the relevance of considering the media environment to better explain the link between CSR and FP. In doing so, this study enriches our understanding of the importance of the media at macro-level institutions by examining how and why these media environments cultivate a culture of CSR as a strategic tool for firms.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Media Accessibility; Financial Performance; Media Freedom; National Media Environment; Signaling Theory","","","Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Evolving sustainably: A longitudinal study of corporate sustainable development, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 3, pp. 197-218, (2005); Barnett, Michael L., Stakeholder influence capacity and the variability of financial returns to corporate social responsibility, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 794-816, (2007); Bednar, Michael K., Burr under the saddle: How media coverage influences strategic change, Organization Science, 24, 3, pp. 910-925, (2013); Bertels, Stephanie, Running Just to Stand Still?

The application of blockchain technologies and environmental and social practices in the context of sustainable finance was analysed, emphasising implementation and prospects in Kyrgyzstan. Blockchain, as an innovative decentralised data recording technology, provides a high level of security, transparency and immutability, which renders it particularly valuable for the financial sector. The study highlighted how blockchain can improve international transfer processes, increase the transparency of financial transactions and simplify the management of smart contracts, and noted existing challenges such as scalability and legal issues. The role of blockchain technologies in sustainable finance, especially in the field of green investments, was highlighted as an important aspect of the study. The introduction of blockchain in areas such as green project financing and social initiative management can help increase investor confidence and improve investment performance. Financial technology is also central in shaping new approaches to finance and investment, facilitating access to capital through crowdfunding and person-to-person (P2P) lending platforms. The introduction of environmental and social practices in financial institutions of the Kyrgyz Republic demonstrates the growing attention to corporate responsibility and sustainable development, despite the initial stage of their implementation. On international stage, successful projects such as the use of blockchain to track supply chains, green bonds and carbon credit management demonstrate the potential of technology to improve the transparency and efficiency of sustainable finance. These examples can be used by Kyrgyzstan in developing and implementing domestic blockchain and environmental and social initiatives, contributing to more sustainable economic growth and attracting international investment.","Digital Transformation; Environmental And Social Practices; Environmental Factors; Risk Management; Technology Integration","","","Ahl, Amanda, Challenges and opportunities of blockchain energy applications: Interrelatedness among technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 166, (2022); Financial Reports; Alabi, Michael Omotayo, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAINS: TOWARDS REVOLUTIONIZING THE INDUSTRY OF THE FUTURE, pp. 527-536, (2021); Blockchains, (2024); International Journal of Technology Innovation and Management Ijtim, (2021); Anvar Kyzy, Saikal, Chain and silk: alternative futures of blockchain governance in Kyrgyzstan, European Journal of Futures Research, 10, 1, (2022); Financial Statements; Social Responsibility, (2025); World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Financial Regulation and Governance, (2016)","","Mukachevo State University","23138114; 25181254","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210430608"

However, few studies have focused on their interaction effects on ESG performance (ESGP). The study selected Chinese A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2023 as the research sample and used a moderating effect model to test the complementary or substitutive relationship between the two. The empirical results show that there is a substitutive effect, rather than a complementary one. Further analysis of the individual ESG pillars revealed that the substitutive effect of BI and DT is primarily reflected in corporate governance. Moreover, this substitutive effect is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises and non-manufacturing enterprises, and digital supervision mechanisms may have a stronger substitutive role than traditional independent director oversight mechanisms. These findings uncover the complex relationship between the two governance mechanisms and corporate ESGP, offering important insights for managers; companies need to strike a balance between “human governance” and “digital governance” to maximize ESGP.","Board Independence; Corporate Governance; Digital Transformation; Esg Performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Governance Approach; Independence; Industrial Performance; State Owned Enterprise; Transformation","corporate social responsibility; digitization; governance approach; independence; industrial performance; state owned enterprise; transformation","","Christensen, Dane M., Why is Corporate Virtue in the Eye of The Beholder?

Based on the data of 1178 A-share listed companies in China's Shanghai and Shenzhen markets from 2014 to 2021, this study empirically analyses the impact of regional digitalization on corporate ESG performance by constructing a double-difference model using the establishment of China's National Pilot Zone for the Innovative Development of the Digital Economy. This paper found that regional digital construction can improve corporate ESG performance by enhancing corporate environmental information disclosure, improving the scale of social donations, and enhancing risk resilience. In addition, the higher the level of public environmental concern in the region, the more obvious the enhancement of digital construction on corporate ESG performance. The contribution of regional digital construction to corporate ESG is also stronger in firms with high executive environmental awareness than in those with low. At the same time, this paper also responds to some scholars' questioning of corporate ESG by verifying that corporate ESG report disclosure is motivated by corporate sustainability rather than self-impression management from the dimensions of corporate management's manipulation of information and the corporate's actual environmental behavior. This paper enriches the research on the impact of the external digital environment on corporate ESG performance. It is of great significance for developing countries to promote the active participation of enterprises in ESG practices through the opportunity of digital development.","Corporate Esg Performance; Difference-in-differences; Quasi-natural Experiment; Regional Digitization; Corporate Esg Performance; Corporates; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Digital Construction; Digitisation; Natural Experiment; Performance; Quasi-natural Experiment; Regional Digitization","Corporate ESG performance; Corporates; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Digital construction; Digitisation; Natural experiment; Performance; Quasi-natural experiment; Regional digitization","","Ahmadova, Gozal, Too good to be true: The inverted U-shaped relationship between home-country digitalization and environmental performance, Ecological Economics, 196, (2022); Prediction of Corporate Bankruptcy A Discriminant Analysis, (1967); Appiah-Kubi, Elias, Management knowledge and sustainability reporting in SMEs: The role of perceived benefit and stakeholder pressure, Journal of Cleaner Production, 434, (2024); Arnold, Beth, Enron: An examination of agency problems, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 15, 6-7, pp. 751-765, (2004); Ashbaugh-Skaife, Hollis, The effect of SOX internal control deficiencies on firm risk and cost of equity, Journal of Accounting Research, 47, 1, pp. 1-43, (2009); Aversa, Paolo, Customer complementarity in the digital space: Exploring Amazon's business model diversification, Long Range Planning, 54, 5, (2021); Ayerbe, Elixabete, Digitalization of Battery Manufacturing: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities, Advanced Energy Materials, 12, 17, (2022); Bai, Xiong, ESG performance, institutional investors’ preference and financing constraints: Empirical evidence from China, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, pp. S157-S168, (2022); Behl, Abhishek, Exploring the relationship of ESG score and firm value using cross-lagged panel analyses: case of the Indian energy sector, Annals of Operations Research, 313, 1, pp. 231-256, (2022); Benlemlih, Mohammed, Environmental and Social Disclosures and Firm Risk, Journal of Business Ethics, 152, 3, pp. 613-626, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202999034"

Furthermore, we find that digital innovation improves CSR performance by increasing employee income and reducing environmental pollution. This study contributes to the existing literature on the emerging field of digital innovation and provides new practical methods for firm managers to enhance CSR performance.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Innovation; Digital Knowledge; High-tech Firms; Patents And Inventions; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Innovations; Digital Knowledge; Economic Consequences; Economic Impacts; Endogeneity; Environmental Pollutions; High-tech Firms; Performance; Text Analysis; Economic And Social Effects; Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Size; Innovation; Knowledge Based System; Performance Assessment; Technological Development","Patents and inventions; Corporate social responsibility; Digital innovations; Digital knowledge; Economic consequences; Economic impacts; Endogeneity; Environmental pollutions; High-tech firms; Performance; Text analysis; Economic and social effects; corporate social responsibility; firm size; innovation; knowledge based system; performance assessment; technological development","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 72372157 ).; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (71972068, 72372157).","Albitar, Khaldoon, Sustainability, Environmental Responsibility and Innovation, Green Finance, 5, 1, pp. 85-88, (2023); Albitar, Khaldoon, Corporate commitment to climate change: The effect of eco-innovation and climate governance, Research Policy, 52, 2, (2023); Augustsson, Nils Petter, Managing digital infrastructures: negotiating control and drift in service provisioning, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 30, 1, pp. 51-78, (2019); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney, Jay Bryan, Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 643-650, (2001); Branco, Manuel Castelo, Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives, Journal of Business Ethics, 69, 2, pp. 111-132, (2006); Chen, Yi, How does green credit policy improve corporate social responsibility in China?

They face serious moral legitimacy issues, due to their power to act as private rule-makers in underregulated digital spheres. Such legitimacy issues have remained underexplored thus far, as have gatekeepers’ options for addressing them. Yet moral legitimacy represents a vital resource for organizations, as a justification of their essential right to exist. Drawing on recent advances in political corporate social responsibility theory, this study offers a systematic conceptualization of how gatekeepers can exhibit ethical responsibility in their efforts to gain, maintain, and sustain their moral legitimacy. This systematic conceptualization encompasses different agreement-seeking procedures, online deliberation, a hybrid governance approach that combines regulation and self-regulation, and the provision of public goods.","Deliberative Democracy; Digital Platforms; Gatekeepers; Moral Legitimacy; Online Deliberation; Political Csr","","","Abbott, Kenneth W., Hard and soft law in international governance, International Organization, 54, 3, pp. 421-456, (2000); Abbott, Kenneth W., The spectrum of international institutions: An interdisciplinary collaboration on global governance, pp. 1-288, (2021); Acosta, Pilar, Revisiting Politics in Political CSR: How coercive and deliberative dynamics operate through institutional work in a Colombian company, Organization Studies, 42, 7, pp. 1111-1134, (2021); Designing an Eu Intervention Standard for Digital Platforms, (2020); Alnemr, Nardine, Emancipation cannot be programmed: blind spots of algorithmic facilitation in online deliberation, Contemporary Politics, pp. 531-552, (2020); Arai, Koki, A methodology for assessing high-Tech regulation: a legitimacy perspective, International Review of Law, Computers and Technology, 35, 3, pp. 288-300, (2021); Arenas, Daniel, Contestation in multi-stakeholder initiatives: Enhancing the democratic quality of transnational governance, Business Ethics Quarterly, 30, 2, pp. 169-199, (2020); Aytaç, Ugur, Digital Domination: Social Media and Contestatory Democracy, Political Studies, 72, 1, pp. 6-25, (2024); Oxford Handbook of Deliberative Democracy, (2018); Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby, Governing the global corporation: A critical perspective, Business Ethics Quarterly, 20, 2, pp. 265-274, (2010)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","00442372","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200009478"

Given that the island is responsible for the manufacturing of a significant part of worldwide electronics components (including the most advanced CMOS technology nodes), the sustainability of the Taiwanese electronics industry is of critical interest. In this paper, we survey the environmental footprint of 16 Taiwanese electronic components manufacturers (ECMs) using corporate sustainability responsibility reports. Based on data from 2015 to 2020, we find out that the sample of ECMs in this study increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5% per year, its final energy and electricity consumption by 8.8% and 8.9%, and its water usage by 6.1%. We show that the volume of manufactured electronic components and the environmental footprint compiled in this study are strongly correlated, which suggests that relative efficiency gains are not sufficient to curb the overall environmental footprint of ECMs on the island. Given the critical nature of the electronics industry for Taiwan's geopolitics and economics, the observed increase of energy consumption, and the slow renewable energy roll-out, Taiwan could face a carbon lock-in situation which will most likely prevent the achievement of carbon reduction goals and sustainability policies on the island.","Digital; Electronics; Industrial Ecology; Manufacturing; Sustainability; Taiwan; Carbon; Ecology; Electronic Equipment; Electronics Industry; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Locks (fasteners); Network Components; Silicon; Sustainable Development; Carbon Lock-in; Component Manufacturers; Component Manufacturing; Digital; Electronic Component; Electronic Industries; Environmental Footprints; Industrial Ecology; Industrial Production; Taiwan; Energy Utilization; Alternative Energy; Digitization; Ecological Footprint; Electronics Industry; Geopolitics; Greenhouse Gas; Industrial Production; Manufacturing; Silicon","Carbon; Ecology; Electronic equipment; Electronics industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Locks (fasteners); Network components; Silicon; Sustainable development; Carbon lock-in; Component manufacturers; Component manufacturing; Digital; Electronic component; Electronic industries; Environmental footprints; Industrial ecology; Industrial production; Taiwan; Energy utilization; alternative energy; digitization; ecological footprint; electronics industry; geopolitics; greenhouse gas; industrial production; manufacturing; silicon","This work was supported by the Fonds Europ\u00E9en de D\u00E9veloppement R\u00E9gional (FEDER) and the Wallonia within the Wallonie-2020.EU\u00A0program.","Comments of the ACM Europe Technology Policy Committee on the Proposal for A Regulation Establishing A Framework of Measures for Strengthening Europes Semiconductor Ecosystem, (2022); Silicon Shield Taiwan S Protection Against Chinese Attack, (2001); García-Bardon, Marie, DTCO including Sustainability: Power-performance-area-cost-environmental score (PPACE) analysis for logic technologies, Technical Digest - International Electron Devices Meeting, 2020-December, pp. 41.4.1-41.4.4, (2020); 2019 Refinement to the 2006 Ipcc Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, (2019); Bol, David, Moore's Law and ICT Innovation in the Anthropocene, Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE, 2021-February, pp. 19-24, (2021); Boyd, Sarah B., Life-cycle assessment of semiconductors, 9781441999887, pp. 1-226, (2012); Energy Statistics Handbook 2010, (2011); Dream Technology Scares People to Death Tsmcs New Plant Consumes More Electricity than the Entire Eastern Taiwan, (2017); Chiu, Huamei, The dark side of silicon Island: High-tech pollution and the environmental movement in Taiwan, Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 22, 1, pp. 40-57, (2011); Chou, Kuei Tien, The conundrums of sustainability: Carbon emissions and electricity consumption in the electronics and petrochemical industries in Taiwan, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 20, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","15309290; 10881980","","JINEF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199394622"

This paper develops a technology–organization–environment (TOE) configurational framework, adopts fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), collects data from 42 enterprises with business model platformization, and analyzes what combinations of digital intelligence technology, platform architecture, dynamic capability, demand evolution, and peer competition constitute a high social value configuration. The study suggests that four configurations of the three main types, resource-driven, demand-driven, and total factor-driven, constitute equivalent paths to high social value. With the help of the TOE framework to identify the configurations of business model platformization to create high social value, this paper provides theoretical support for enterprises aiming to create high social value in the face of peer competition and joint changes in the demand environment to choose the appropriate path of business model platformization from their own point of view.","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71972153); Major Research Topics of Degree and Postgraduate Education in China (2020ZAC7); and Doctoral Dissertation Innovation Fund of Xi'an University of Technology (310\u2010252072119).

In Germany, this self-governance approach influenced the political discussions and led to a more integrative and collaborative multi-policy strategy beyond pure regulatory regimes. The launch of the German CDR-code by the German action group in June 2021 is a milestone to capture ethical problems in digitalised firms by voluntary commitments from signatories. However, little empirical evidence on the current state of CDR-initiatives at German corporations is available up-to now. This article addresses the identified research gap by performing a qualitative analysis of the disclosed information on CDR in nonfinancial reports of the DAX 30 companies from 2020. After a brief introduction, a literature review on CDR-related research activities is presented in Sect. 2, and the context and background of the study are specified. Section 3 presents the results of the empirical study on disclosed CDR-related information by German DAX 30 companies. Section 4 concludes with a discussion and discovers future research avenues on CDR.

In this context, the concept of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) is of increasing interest to practitioners. Drawing on the well-established paradigm of Corporate Social Responsibility, CDR comprises a set of principles designed to encourage the ethical and conscientious development, adoption, and utilization of digital technologies. This work aims at contributing to the evolving research base by empirically assessing consumer preferences and a consumer segmentation approach with regard to companies’ concrete CDR activities, thus supporting the operationalization of CDR. Hence, this work provides concrete guidance for firms’ CDR activities in practice. To this end, a series of Best–Worst Scaling and dual response studies with a representative sample of 663 German-speaking participants assesses consumers’ perspectives on firms’ concrete (possible) activities within several CDR dimensions. Both DURE studies reveal the potential halo effect of data privacy and security activities on the perception of the CDR engagement at large, suggesting a more holistic approach to digital responsibilities. Besides, the findings reveal that in case of CDR one size does not fit all. Especially in terms of informational approaches, consumer preferences are rather heterogeneous suggesting that consumer segmentation is beneficial for companies. Additionally, the high importance of price for the consumers’ evaluation shows that it can be useful to offer a slimmed-down version in terms of CDR activities for more price-conscious consumers.","Consumer Preferences; Consumer Segmentation; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Discrete Choice Experiments; Dual Response; Ethical Guidelines; O30","","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy under Grant Agreement number 01MD16009F (ENTOURAGE) and the Hessian State Chancellery-Hessian Minister of Digital Strategy and Development under the promotional reference 6/493/71574093 (CDR-CAT).; Funding text 2: Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Based on statistics from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), the second largest women population among 15 years as well as 19 years was in 2017 only behind 35 and 39 years. At this time, the Brazilian male population was higher. The difficulties of the young generation affected the preceding generation and promoted social dynamism. The worldwide data shows that the generation of young and the digital world have been constantly sought, but in reality, approximately one-third of the population in 2017 had no access to the internet. Design/methodology/approach: The worldwide movement around topics such as strategy on its threefold basis and Industry 4.0 enable a link to company duty towards society to be established. This present study was produced from 1 March 2020 to 2 September 2020 via resources of human and literature evaluation relating to the idea of strategic, Industry 4.0, the responsibility of society and the creation of youth. Its motive is the global creation of youth. Two recommendations should be made after studying the literature and information gathering that enabled “analyzing social responsibility of the company and industry 4.0 with a pivot on young creation: a strategic framework for resources of human management”.

While offering substantial benefits, CLSC adopt ion f aces challenges, including high infrastructure costs, complex reverse coordination, and inconsistent regulatory support, which hinder widespread application. Through a mixed-method approach using surveys and case studies, this study reveals barriers such as financial constraints and operational restructuring needs, while highlighting enablers like digital tools (e.g., blockchain, IoT) that enhance efficiency and transparency. Furthermore, it emphasizes the critical role of regulatory incentives (subsidies, tax breaks, and extended producer responsibility mandates) and strategic partnerships that pool resources and share risks, essential for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) aiming to implement CLSCs effectively. By proposing a practical CLSC framework, informed by empirical data, this research provides actionable insights for businesses to embrace circular economy principles, aligning environment al responsibility with corporate resilience, profit ability, and consumer expect at ions. CLSCs, therefore, are not only an environment al solution but also a strategic opportunity that addresses sustainability imperatives while meet ingregulatory requirements and advancing competitive advantage.","Circular Economy; Closed-loop Supply Chains; Regulatory Support; Sustainability; Technological Innovat Ion","","Supporting Innovation through Research and Development Grants: Governments can provide grants or funding opportunities specifically aimed at innovation in sustainable supply chain practices, particularly for SMEs that may lack the resources for such investments. Funding could focus on developing advanced materials, improving product design for sustainability, and creating new recycling technologies, thereby supporting the technological advancements necessary for CLSC's success. Research and development grants aimed at CLSC innovation can encourage experimentation and reduce the financial risks associated with pioneering sustainable technologies. Such funding could be allocated toward projectsthat demonstrate the potential for scalability and high impact, fostering a culture of continuous improvement in sustainable supply chains (Yang et al., 2024).","Adam, Niimas Ayu Frensilia Putri, Manufacturer-retailer coordination in a closed-loop supply chain system with emission reduction, government incentives, and energy-saving level, Cogent Engineering, 9, 1, (2022); Amadi, Alolote Ibim, Integration in a mixed-method case study of construction phenomena: from data to theory, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 30, 1, pp. 210-237, (2023); Andreoni, Martin Andreoni, Enhancing Autonomous System Security and Resilience With Generative AI: A Comprehensive Survey, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 109470-109493, (2024); Bhatia, Manjot Singh, Key capabilities for closed-loop supply chain: Empirical evidence from manufacturing firms, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 208, (2024); Butt, Atif S., The role of reverse logistics in a circular economy for achieving sustainable development goals: a multiple case study of retail firms, Production Planning and Control, 35, 12, pp. 1490-1502, (2024); Corallo, Angelo, Leveraging on technology and sustainability to innovate the supply chain: a proposal of agri-food value chain model, Supply Chain Management, 29, 3, pp. 661-683, (2024); Correia, Elisabete, Sustainability supply chain practices: proposal for a framework, International Journal of Logistics Management, 35, 1, pp. 187-209, (2024); Journal of Practical Studies in Education, (2021); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., “Real impact”: Challenges and opportunities in bridging the gap between research and practice – Making a difference in industry, policy, and society, International Journal of Information Management, 78, (2024); Technology as A Solution to the Supply Chain Problems in the United States What More can Be Done, (2024)","","Creative Publishing House","27526798; 27526801","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210036949"

Specific features of the current situation are discussed: the temporality of socio-technological transformations, which is becoming less and less compatible with the harmonious development of man and society; the pace at which machines acquire intelligence; the total devaluation of mental labour; the unresolved issue of the role of man in the world of intelligent machines; and the criticality of the problem of the labour market due to its global nature, social significance and the rate of socio-technological changes. It is emphasised that these circumstances, already in the short term, threaten the sustainable development of global society, whose reactions to the transformation of technological and socio-economic infrastructure are significantly lagging behind. It is concluded that there is an urgent need to strengthen social responsibility, determined by the new ethics of relations between humans and machines with AI, supplemented by the primacy of the dignity of the social role of humans. The authors point out the urgent need to revise ideas about work as the main purpose of a person and about realisation in the profession as the main factor that determines the self-esteem of an individual and his social status.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Chatgpt; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transit; Labour Market; Pace Of Development; Professional Employment; Sustainable Development; Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Social Responsibility; Employment; Ethics; Infrastructural Development; Labor Market; Machinery; Sustainable Development","artificial intelligence; corporate social responsibility; employment; ethics; infrastructural development; labor market; machinery; sustainable development","","Shestakova, I.

However, the excessive use of algorithms for differential pricing has sparked discussions about fairness and price discrimination, disrupting the platform trading system. To address this challenge, we adopt an evolutionary game approach to analyze the evolutionary strategies of all parties from the perspective of platform CSR. It is based on a special type of e-commerce platform trading in which major merchants have data analytics capabilities. We construct an evolutionary game model considering reputation and punishment, explore the impact of different situations and factors on the system’s evolutionary stability strategy, and conduct its verification via simulation experiments. The results show that long-term reputation is the internal driving force for platforms to fulfill responsibilities. The joint punishment of collusion is the external binding force. Consumer complaints are key to restricting merchants’ integrity operation. Moreover, penalties imposed by e-commerce platforms can help eradicate price discrimination. This study provides a new perspective to solve price discrimination in the digital era. Measures based on reputation and punishment can guide platforms to fulfill other social responsibilities.","Consumer Complaints; Platform Corporate Social Responsibility; Price Discrimination; Punishment; Reputation","","","Wang, Chenglu, Editorial – What is an interactive marketing perspective and what are emerging research areas?, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 18, 2, pp. 161-165, (2024); Zimmermann, Robert, Enhancing brick-and-mortar store shopping experience with an augmented reality shopping assistant application using personalized recommendations and explainable artificial intelligence, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 17, 2, pp. 273-298, (2023); Kim, Junic, Live Commerce Platforms: A New Paradigm for E-Commerce Platform Economy, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 18, 2, pp. 959-975, (2023); Cao, Guangming, Big Data, Marketing Analytics, and Firm Marketing Capabilities, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 62, 3, pp. 442-451, (2022); Li, Rui, The digital economy, enterprise digital transformation, and enterprise innovation, Managerial and Decision Economics, (2022); Lee, Jennifer Joo Yeon, How do consumers choose offline shops on online platforms?

Meanwhile, the impact of digital transformation on green innovation in the manufacturing industry has been proven to be significant in a previous study. To further explore the impact of digital transformation on the development of green innovation in the manufacturing industry under the dual carbon goal, this article selects data from Chinese A-share manufacturing listed companies from 2013 to 2022 as the observation sample, proposes research hypotheses based on stakeholder theory, and conducts empirical analysis. The results indicate that digital transformation can significantly promote the development of green innovation in the manufacturing industry, which is transmitted through corporate environmental responsibility. Corporate environmental responsibility plays a partial mediating role in the impact of digital transformation on the development of green innovation. Meanwhile, media attention can strengthen the positive impact of digital transformation on green innovation. In heterogeneity analysis, it was found that the higher the institutional shareholding and analyst attention, the more likely a company’s digital transformation can promote green innovation. In addition, by comparing and analyzing the data of the two years before and after the proposal of the dual carbon target, it was found that the incentive effect of the dual carbon target did not achieve the expected effect in this article, which may be related to the short time of the proposal of the dual carbon target and the impact of the epidemic.","Development; Digital Transformation; Green Innovation; Manufacturing; Carbon Emission; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Heterogeneity; Innovation; Manufacturing; Reduction; Stakeholder","carbon emission; corporate social responsibility; digitization; heterogeneity; innovation; manufacturing; reduction; stakeholder","This research was funded by Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, grant number 23YJC630207.","Shi, Beibei, Market incentives, carbon quota allocation and carbon emission reduction: Evidence from China's carbon trading pilot policy, Journal of Environmental Management, 319, (2022); Pan, An, Climate policy and low-carbon innovation: Evidence from low-carbon city pilots in China, Energy Economics, 112, (2022); Gao, Jun, Does Digital Transformation Contribute to Corporate Carbon Emissions Reduction?

Using the data of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies in China's heavily polluting industries, this study showed that both environmental regulation and digital media coverage significantly improve responsive and strategic environmental responsibility fulfillment. After distinguishing the media tone, it was found that positive digital media coverage promotes the fulfillment of both responsive and strategic environmental responsibilities. In contrast, negative digital media coverage only stimulates the fulfillment of responsive environmental responsibility, which reflected an asymmetrical effect of media tone. Further, the hierarchy of governance amplifies the role of environmental regulation in triggering the fulfillment of responsive environmental responsibility but weakens its value to strategic environmental responsibility. Inconsistent with our predictions, the relationship between digital media coverage and corporate environmental responsibility fulfillment could not be significantly moderated by Confucian culture.

Complementing the literature with novel neuroimaging techniques can provide direct evidence of related implicit mental processes. This study uses privacy-related behavior adopted by corporations in the digital age to decipher brain mechanisms that underlie consumers’ reactions to breaches of privacy, thus providing implicit evidence that consumers perceive pain from such breaches. In Study 1, an online experiment used corporations’ behaviors to delve into underlying psychological mechanisms that shaped consumers’ responses to certain kinds of corporate use of private information. Our findings highlight the perceived harm resulting from privacy breaches and its effects on consumers’ intentions to take punitive action against companies that are responsible for such breaches. In Study 2, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify brain regions involved in these implicit responses. In the course of this study, we observed a correlation between consumers’ perception of harm from corporations’ improper use of private information and brain activation in regions of the amygdala and the temporoparietal junction. The inferior parietal lobule and the anterior cingulate cortex were also found to play roles in evaluating such behavior. By leveraging these novel neuroanatomical insights, our study explains consumers’ inclination to avoid harm in response to privacy breaches and their behavior in response to improper use of their information.","Consumer Neuroscience; Corporate Social Responsibility; Fmri; Privacy Harm","","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge generous research support from KOM & S CORP.

What impedes business organizations from heeding scholarly advice to engage in crisis planning? Interviews with corporate communication professionals suggest that in a fast-evolving digital landscape characterized by the ambiguity of what ‘qualifies’ as a crisis, the need for an organizational culture of preparedness and balancing structure with agility are the hallmarks of crisis planning. Even when interviewees acknowledge the importance of crisis planning, cultivating a culture of preparedness is contingent on an engaged leadership that recognizes and provides communication professionals a seat at the table, fosters internal coordination, and understands the importance of peacetime relationships with stakeholders.

It helps companies enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness, gradually becoming a key driver for corporate sustainable development. This study selects Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2021 as research samples and empirically tests the impact of supply chain digitalization on corporate environment (E), social responsibility (S), and corporate governance (G) (ESG) performance. We find that supply chain digitalization significantly promotes corporate ESG performance, which is achieved by reducing information asymmetry and easing financing constraints. The positive effect of supply chain digitalization on corporate ESG performance varies significantly among different enterprises, with more prominent effects in mature enterprises, those at both ends of the industrial chain, and those located in regions with lower degree of marketization. Further analysis reveals that supply chain digitalization brings about an innovation effect for enterprises. These findings enrich the research on supply chain digitalization and corporate ESG performance, providing valuable insights for promoting supply-side structural reforms and corporate sustainable development.","","","This research received the financial support from the MOE project of Humanities and Social Science (21YJC630093), and the China Postdoctoral Fund Program (2021M702070).","Academy of Management Annals, (2008); Antràs, Pol, Measuring the upstreamness of production and trade flows, American Economic Review, 102, 3, pp. 412-416, (2012); Awan, Usama, Industry 4.0 and the circular economy: A literature review and recommendations for future research, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 4, pp. 2038-2060, (2021); Baker, Edward D., ESG government risk and international IPO underpricing, Journal of Corporate Finance, 67, (2021); Bao, Xin, Corporate integrity culture on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 31, 2, pp. 1399-1417, (2024); Broadstock, David C., The role of ESG performance during times of financial crisis: Evidence from COVID-19 in China, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Cai, Cen, Enterprise digital transformation and ESG performance, Finance Research Letters, 58, (2023); Cao, Yu, Does environmental credit rating policy improve corporate ESG performance?, Sustainable Development, 32, 5, pp. 4329-4337, (2024); Chan, Chiaying, Do financial constraints matter when firms engage in CSR?, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 39, pp. 241-259, (2017); Chen, Pengyu, Digital transformation and corporate environmental performance: The moderating role of board characteristics, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1757-1767, (2022)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","15367150; 00029246","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197302205"

How to adopt digital technology to promote corporate green innovation (CGI) has become a widespread topic among scholars. This paper examines how digital transformation influences CGI in Chinese non-financial listed companies from 2008 to 2020. Using textual analysis to construct indicators of digital transformation, we find that CGI can be significantly enhanced by enterprise digital transformation in both quantity and quality. We also explore the underlying channels and find that enterprise digital transformation promotes CGI by improving environmental management, human capital upgrading, and resource allocation efficiency. Moreover, we investigate the moderating effects of various factors and conclude that enterprise digital transformation’s favorable effects on CGI are more pronounced in companies with good environmental responsibility, labor-intensive industries, high financial risks, intense market competition, and state-owned enterprises, as well as in companies located in regions with strong environmental regulations and a low level of digital economy development. This paper contributes to the literature on green innovation and digital transformation, as well as provides empirical evidence for enterprises in emerging market countries to promote energy saving and green transformation using digital technology.","Digital Transformation; Environmental Management; Green Innovation; Human Capital; Resource Allocation Efficiency; Environmental Management; Green Economy; Innovation; Resource Allocation; Sustainable Development; China","environmental management; green economy; innovation; resource allocation; sustainable development; China","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 71902028), the National Social Science Foundation of China (17BGL233), and the Startup Research Foundation of Young teachers of Capital University of Economics and Business (XRZ2024027).","Abdullah, Mirza, Barriers to green innovation initiatives among manufacturers: the Malaysian case, Review of Managerial Science, 10, 4, pp. 683-709, (2016); Acemoglu, Daron, The race between man and machine: Implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment, American Economic Review, 108, 6, pp. 1488-1542, (2018); Alexopoulos, Michelle, The medium is the measure: Technical change and employment, 1909-1949, Review of Economics and Statistics, 98, 4, pp. 792-810, (2016); Attaran, Mohsen, Exploring the relationship between information technology and business process reengineering, Information and Management, 41, 5, pp. 585-596, (2004); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Berry, Michael A., Proactive corporate environmental management: A new industrial revolution, Academy of Management Executive, 12, 2, pp. 38-50, (1998); Böhringer, Christoph, Clean and productive?

This framework attributes the heterogeneity of ESG practices to differences in the ability and willingness of companies. Using data from Chinese listed companies, we find that the digital transformation is improving ESG performance. The mechanism is that digital transformation increases the availability of long-term slack resources and strengthens the connection with stakeholders. However, there is insufficient evidence that digital transformation contributes to greater transparency in corporate disclosure. We also find that this effect is larger for firms with less risk-responsiveness and firms with international connections, but smaller for firms with political connections. Our findings affirm the advantages of contemporary trends in corporate digital transformation for ESG practices and offer a new theoretical framework to investigate the factors influencing ESG practices.","Digital Transformation; Esg Practices; Slack Resources Theory; Stakeholder Theory; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Governance Approach; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development; Theoretical Study; Trend Analysis; China","corporate social responsibility; governance approach; stakeholder; sustainable development; theoretical study; trend analysis; China","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports by \u201CResearch Results of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) Marxist Theory Research and Discipline Construction Program Project\u201D (MX2311) and \u201CThe Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences in Hubei Ordinary Institutions of Higher Education\u2013Research Center of College Student Development and Innovative Education of China University of Geosciences\u201D (DXS20150012).

Companies with a higher corporate social responsibility (CSR) level not only help encourage employees to focus on their goals, but they also show that they take their social responsibility seriously, which is increasingly important in today’s digital economy. So, this study aims to examine the relationship between digital transformation and CSR disclosure of Chinese A-share companies. Furthermore, this research investigates the moderating impact of governance heterogeneity, including CEO power and corporate internal control (INT) mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: This study used fixed effect estimation with robust standard errors to examine the relationship between digital transformation and CSR disclosure and the moderating effect of governance heterogeneity among Chinese A-share companies from 2010 to 2020. The whole sample consists of 17,266 firms, including 5,038 state-owned enterprise (SOE) company records and 12,228 non-SOE records. The whole sample data is collected from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research, the Chinese Research Data Services and the WIND databases. Findings: The regression results lead us to three conclusions after classifying the sample into non-SOE and SOE groups. First, Chinese A-share businesses with greater levels of digitalization have lower CSR disclosures. Both SOE and non-SOE are consistent with these findings. Second, increasing CEO authority creates a more centralized company decision-making structure (Breuer et al., 2022; Freire, 2019), which improves the negative association between digitalization and CSR disclosure. These conclusions, however, also apply to non-SOE. Finally, INT reinforces the association between corporate digitization and CSR disclosure, which is especially obvious in SOEs. These findings are robust to alternative HEXUN CSR disclosure index. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative relationship between corporate digitalization and CSR disclosures is more pronounced in bigger, highly levered and highly financialized firms. Originality/value: Digitalization and CSR disclosure are well studied, but few have examined their interactions from a governance heterogeneity perspective in China. Practitioners and policymakers may use these insights to help business owners implement suitable digital policies for firm development from diverse business perspectives.","Ceo Power; Chinese A-share Firms; Corporate Digital Transformation; Csr Disclosure; Governance Heterogeneity; Internal Control; Soe And Non-soe","","","Agyei-Mensah, Ben Kwame, Internal control information disclosure and corporate governance: evidence from an emerging market, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 16, 1, pp. 79-95, (2016); Ahsan, Tanveer, Corporate social responsibility and firm-value: the role of sensitive industries and CEOs power in China, Applied Economics, 54, 16, pp. 1844-1863, (2022); Andersson, Lynne M., Individual environmental initiative: Championing natural environmental issues in U.S. business organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 548-570, (2000); Barauskaite, Gerda, Corporate social responsibility and financial performance of companies: The puzzle of concepts, definitions and assessment methods, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 28, 1, pp. 278-287, (2021); Bharadwaj, Anandhi S., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Bokpin, Godfred Alufar, Ownership structure, corporate governance and capital structure decisions of firms: Empirical evidence from Ghana, Studies in Economics and Finance, 26, 4, pp. 246-256, (2009); Breuer, Wolfgang, The impact of CEO power and institutional discretion on CSR investment, Review of Financial Economics, 40, 1, pp. 20-43, (2022); Brown, James R., Cash holdings and R&D smoothing, Journal of Corporate Finance, 17, 3, pp. 694-709, (2011); Chan, Kam C., The Linear and Non-Linear Effects of Internal Control and Its Five Components on Corporate Innovation: Evidence from Chinese Firms Using the COSO Framework, European Accounting Review, 30, 4, pp. 733-765, (2021); Che, Tong, Digital transformation drives product quality improvement: An organizational transparency perspective, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 197, (2023)","","Emerald Publishing","14720701","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188810786"

The service sector is no exception from these technological advances. Given its potential and significance, five major areas whereby ChatGPT has great potential in services management are identified and discussed in terms of opportunities, challenges and research agendas: service marketing, customer experience, digital services, cost-effective service excellence, and ethical and corporate digital responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: By adopting an expert-oriented perspective approach, the study leverages the expertise of 11 knowledgeable contributors from the fields of service and information systems to foresee the implications of ChatGPT in services. The article comprehensively examines the current body of literature and practices in ChatGPT and services and proposes a forward-thinking research agenda for service scholars and practitioners. Findings: The contributors recognize that ChatGPT has the potential to transform service offerings significantly, enrich customer experiences, optimize service costs, and contribute to societal advantages through improved digital services. However, they also acknowledge the disruption ChatGPT may cause to traditional service practices, including the potential loss of human touch in services, challenges to privacy and security, and the potential negative outcomes affecting service consumers and employees in terms of inequality, biases, and misuse of ChatGPT. Originality/value: This article introduces a groundbreaking investigation into the use of ChatGPT in services management. The originality is demonstrated by examining the potential and obstacles to applying ChatGPT in different service domains. In addition, this research serves as a guiding light for subsequent studies by suggesting an in-depth research agenda, including understanding the design and optimization of ChatGPT in the customer service journey, the role of ChatGPT in assisting service organizations to promote responsible services, and implications of ChatGPT on service stakeholders.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatgpt; Customer Experience; Ethics; Generative Ai; Internet And Digital Services; Security; Service Marketing","","","Why is the User Experience of Chatgpt so Powerful Medium, (2022); Bock, Dora Elizabeth, Artificial intelligence: disrupting what we know about services, Journal of Services Marketing, 34, 3, pp. 317-334, (2020); Bornet, Pascal, Intelligent automation: Welcome to the world of hyperautomation: Learn how to harness artificial intelligence to boost business & make our world more human, pp. 1-414, (2020); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy, International Journal of Information Management, 71, (2023); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., Leveraging ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications in the hospitality and tourism industry: practices, challenges and research agenda, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 36, 1, pp. 1-12, (2024); Top 10 Global Consumer Trends, (2019); Gawer, Annabelle, Digital platforms and ecosystems: remarks on the dominant organizational forms of the digital age, Innovation: Organization and Management, 24, 1, pp. 110-124, (2022); Gentile, Chiara, How to Sustain the Customer Experience:.

The results show that DF significantly improves corporate ESG performance in both local and neighbouring regions, and that the improvement in neighbouring regions is mainly achieved through labour mobility, capital mobility, and technology diffusion. A heterogeneity analysis further revealed that DF improves corporate ESG performance more significantly in regions with large-scale economies and well-developed digital infrastructure. These findings provide a timely evaluation of the social value of DF in emerging economies like China, viewed through the lens of ESG, and highlight the spatial spillover effects of DF on corporate ESG performance.

The findings indicate that using social media channels to communicate green initiatives is effective for brands. Moreover, the study concludes that direct brand communication is more beneficial than relying on digital influencers. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the comparative effectiveness of brand-generated social media posts and influencer-generated content in promoting green activism actions.

We argue that platforms transcend mere communication channels, acting as catalysts for innovation and collaboration among startups, thereby driving economic, social, and environmental progress. Our framework emphasizes platform-enabled startups, navigating the unique challenges and opportunities presented by these dynamic markets. We adopt a dual lens, using a mixed-methods approach to analyze digital development trends through the prism of platforms in emerging economies. This reframes the discourse on technology-driven development, acknowledging the unidirectional flow of platform adoption from developed nations. The research emphasizes the need for prioritizing sustainability standards in these regions. Furthermore, we delve into the interplay between platforms and sustainable entrepreneurship with the following three objectives: (1) deciphering the drivers of platform–startup interaction for sustainability goals, (2) formulating policies to maximize platform benefits while mitigating risks, and (3) developing actionable strategies for stakeholders to cultivate a thriving ecosystem of sustainable platform-based ventures. The findings of this study reveal six key uncertainties that will shape the future trajectories of sustainable entrepreneurship within digital ecosystems, particularly in developing nations. These uncertainties encompass the following: environmental and social standards, ongoing education and development, mobile application development and utilization, global market access, and competitiveness and value creation. Several alternative future scenarios have been constructed based on these uncertainties, including advancements in digital technologies, dynamic market conditions and evolving consumer behaviors, a heightened emphasis on sustainability and corporate social responsibility, and a paradigm shift towards collaborative business models. A comprehensive framework of supportive policies and interventions has been proposed to facilitate the realization of these scenarios. Moreover, the analysis underscores the pivotal roles of digital platform providers and startups as key stakeholders in this evolving landscape.","Developing Countries; Digital Platforms; Economic Sustainability; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Mactor Method; Multipol Method; Startup; Sustainable Development; Competitiveness; Digitization; Fuzzy Mathematics; Innovation; Market Conditions; Paradigm Shift; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","competitiveness; digitization; fuzzy mathematics; innovation; market conditions; paradigm shift; sustainability; sustainable development","","World, (2024); Khalil, Afef, Do Digital Technologies Influence the Relationship between the COVID-19 Crisis and SMEs’ Resilience in Developing Countries?, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 2, (2022); Rahman, Md Sadekur, Impact of mobile phone usage on empowerment of rural women entrepreneurs: Evidence from rural Bangladesh, Heliyon, 9, 11, (2023); Santos, Susana Correia, How digitalization reinvented entrepreneurial resilience during COVID-19, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 189, (2023); Khoo, Catheryn, Opportunities and challenges of digital competencies for women tourism entrepreneurs in Latin America: a gendered perspective, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 32, 3, pp. 519-539, (2024); Wibowo, Agus, How does digital entrepreneurship education promote entrepreneurial intention?

In this study, Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2022 are selected as samples. Using text analysis technology, indicators of 'digital transformation' from corporate annual reports are identified and extracted to assess the extent of enterprise digital transformation. Then the impact of corporate digital transformation on corporate financial mismatch and its underlying mechanisms are systematically investigated. The study shows that enterprise digital transformation significantly alleviates the degree of corporate financial mismatch. This influence is achieved by easing enterprises' financing constraints, promoting technological innovation, and enhancing their level of social responsibility. The heterogeneity test shows that digital transformation has a greater mitigation effect on non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises with high degrees of industrial competition, enterprises with high degrees of regional marketization, and technology-intensive enterprises. The research conclusions provide micro-evidence for a deeper understanding of how digital transformation influences the misallocation of corporate financial resources. They also provide important insights for shaping digital economy policies and promoting high-quality development in the financial industry.","Corporate Finance Mismatch; Enterprise Digital Transformation; Text Analysis","","","Acemoglu, Daron, Robots and jobs: Evidence from us labor markets, Journal of Political Economy, 128, 6, pp. 2188-2244, (2020); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); Andriushchenko, Kateryna A., Peculiarities of sustainable development of enterprises in the context of digital transformation, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 7, 3, pp. 2255-2270, (2020); Bae, Gumkwang, The Impact of ESG on Brand Trust and Word of Mouth in Food and Beverage Companies: Focusing on Jeju Island Tourists, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023); Becsi, Zsolt, Credit mismatch and breakdown, European Economic Review, 59, pp. 109-125, (2013); Brandt, Loren, Factor market distortions across time, space and sectors in China, Review of Economic Dynamics, 16, 1, pp. 39-58, (2013); Chen, Zhe, How state-owned equity participation promotes the digital transformation of nonstate-owned enterprises: Evidence from China, Finance Research Letters, 59, (2024); Cheng, Yiran, The effect of digital transformation on real economy enterprises’ total factor productivity, International Review of Economics and Finance, 85, pp. 488-501, (2023); Ghobakhloo, Morteza, Digital transformation success under Industry 4.0: a strategic guideline for manufacturing SMEs, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 32, 8, pp. 1533-1556, (2021); Asia Pacific Journal of Accounting Economics, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","15446123","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195273248"

A hierarchical multiple regression analysis of Chinese listed companies shows a significant positive relationship between CSR and the firm value and a positive moderating effect of digital transformation on the CSR–firm value relationship. According to the three-way interaction analysis results, internal control strengthens the moderating effect of digital transformation, which strengthens the positive relationship between CSR and the firm value.

First, the identification phase required technological surveillance and competitive intelligence, which allowed for defining the organization’s stakeholders and their characteristics. Then, the prioritization phase was performed to determine the stakeholders that potentially will have the greatest impact on achieving the institution’s strategic objectives to the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals prioritized by the institution, and those who will be most affected (positively or negatively) by the HEI activities. Finally, different methods and technological tools were used for consulting internal and external stakeholders, according to the type of relationship with each group, which allowed the understanding of the perceptions of different stakeholder groups on issues such as gender equity, mental health, regenerative economy, and diversity training. The results are then presented in terms of organizational context, where the concept of stakeholder group was defined by the dynamics of the selected HEI; the prioritized stakeholders include students, employees, academic and research sector, public sector, business sector, social sector, community, archdiocese and diocese, alumni, donors, and benefactors. This approach enabled the identification of issues that became a priority in the university’s actions towards the future. Although the presented methodology is mainly qualitative, which can represent a high degree of subjectivity, the stakeholder prioritization exercise provides organizations with inputs for decision making aligned with their needs and expectations. Using such a methodology can help the organization to experience structural changes reflected in improved strategic alignment, understanding, and satisfaction of stakeholders’ expectations and needs, enhancement of reputation, risk and conflict mitigation, and the consolidation of long-term healthy and trustworthy relationships, in the context of Society 5.0, where human-centered solutions are expected.","Corporate Strategy; Industry 5.0; Society 5.0; Stakeholder Responsibility; Stakeholders Prioritization; Sustainable Corporate Governance; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Digitization; Governance Approach; Higher Education; Prioritization; Stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal","corporate strategy; decision making; digitization; governance approach; higher education; prioritization; stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal","This work was developed with the funding of the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB) and with the support of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in association with the Comptroller General of the Republic in the frame of Contract CGR-373-2023.","Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2023); Graf, Andrea, More than seven decades of Acta Tropica: Partnership to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Acta Tropica, 225, (2022); Ali, Syed Mithun, Development Goals towards Sustainability, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 12, (2023); Lukin, Edi, Sustainability Strategies and Achieving SDGs: A Comparative Analysis of Leading Companies in the Automotive Industry, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 7, (2022); Perevoznic, Florentina Madalina, Achieving the 2030 Agenda: Mapping the Landscape of Corporate Sustainability Goals and Policies in the European Union, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 7, (2024); Leiva-Brondo, Miguel, Spanish University Students’ Awareness and Perception of Sustainable Development Goals and Sustainability Literacy, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 8, (2022); Ghobakhloo, Morteza, Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 33, pp. 716-737, (2022); Ghobakhloo, Morteza, A practical guide on strategic roadmapping for information and operations technology management: a case study on industry 5.0 transformation, Journal of Industrial and Production Engineering, 41, 5, pp. 397-421, (2024); Leng, Jiewu, Towards resilience in Industry 5.0: A decentralized autonomous manufacturing paradigm, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 71, pp. 95-114, (2023); Huang, Sihan, Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0—Comparison, complementation and co-evolution, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 64, pp. 424-428, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198487652"

It plays a crucial role in alleviating regulatory pressure, enabling green innovations, enhancing performance, and fostering sustainable development. Despite extensive research in the field, comprehensive reviews and bibliometric analyses remain scarce. To address this gap, this study meticulously analyzed 851 papers indexed in the WoS’s SSCI and SCI from 2004 to 2024. Using visualization tools like VOSviewer and CiteSpace, it conducted a multidimensional bibliometric analysis and systematic review, identifying core authors such as Aseem, Ntim, and Zeng, high-productivity countries including China, the USA, and the UK, and key journals like the Journal of Cleaner Production and Sustainability. Keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis revealed central research themes of environmental information disclosure, innovation, and environmental management systems. Burst analysis highlighted emerging hot topics, notably ecological and green innovation, and the interplay between Total Factor Productivity and environmental regulations. Additionally, we identified several critical gaps in the field. For instance, research on corporate environmental governance mechanisms in the context of digital transformation remains insufficient. Furthermore, the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder collaborative governance frameworks requires ongoing investigation. Therefore, we encourage future researchers to focus on the following topics: digitization and environmental compliance, multi-stakeholder participation mechanisms, cost–benefit analysis of corporate environmental compliance, and the impact of political and regulatory environments on corporate environmental compliance.","Bibliometric Analysis; Corporate Governance; Environmental Compliance; Environmental Performance; Environmental Regulation; Green Innovation; Multi-stakeholder Participation; Sustainability; Bibliography; Compliance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Legislation; Industrial Performance; Innovation; Literature Review; Participatory Approach; Software; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","bibliography; compliance; corporate social responsibility; environmental legislation; industrial performance; innovation; literature review; participatory approach; software; sustainability; sustainable development","This research was funded by Major Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant SK2021ZD03 and in part by The National Social Science Fund of China under Grant 22FFXB062.","Zhao, Xiaofan, Why Do Firms Obey?: the State of Regulatory Compliance Research in China, Journal of Chinese Political Science, 25, 2, pp. 339-352, (2020); Du, Lei, Corporate sustainable development strategies: Under the collaborative governance of government and the public, Sustainable Development, 32, 4, pp. 3055-3064, (2024); Li, Mengjie, Assessing the impact of environmental regulation and environmental co-governance on pollution transfer: Micro-evidence from China, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 86, (2021); Christmann, Petra, Firm self-regulation through international certifiable standards: Determinants of symbolic versus substantive implementation, Journal of International Business Studies, 37, 6, pp. 863-878, (2006); Potoski, Matthew, The Regulation Dilemma: Cooperation and Conflict in Environmental Governance, Public Administration Review, 64, 2, pp. 152-163, (2004); Hong, Xianna, How does command-and-control environmental regulation impact firm value?

Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) plays an important role in promoting a corporate culture of environmental responsibility, ensuring the effectiveness of companies’ environmental strategy through its direct role with employees. In response to the lack of studies on GHRM and its implementation in the Portuguese business context, this study aims to map the GHRM practices implemented by companies operating in Portugal and to identify the perceived benefits, constraints, and challenges in implementing these practices. A total of 15 semi-structured interviews with human resource managers and environment-related management professionals of companies selected from an Environmental Management Systems—ISO 14001 database were conducted. The results show that organizations in Portugal implement environmental practices that fall within the scope of GHRM. The practices identified also range across transversal categories such as digital, mobility, products and waste management, infrastructure, performance, production, and corporate events. However, a holistic approach is needed and GHRM should be built under a multidimensional and well-planned system. This study argues that perceived benefits are constrained by the specific characteristics of the Portuguese business context which results in obstacles for the implementation and success of GHRM practices. The implications of the results for the organizations are discussed and suggestions are put forward.","Environmental Sustainability; Green Human Resource Management (ghrm); Practices; Business; Database; Holistic Approach; Human Resource; Management Practice; Perception; Sustainability; Portugal","business; database; holistic approach; human resource; management practice; perception; sustainability; Portugal","This work is financed by Portuguese national funds through FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, under the project UIDP/05422/2020.","Steil, Carlos Alberto, Além dos humanos: Reflexões sobre o processo de incorporaçäo dos direitos ambientais como direitos humanos nas conferências das nações unidas, Horizontes Antropologicos, 19, 40, pp. 283-309, (2013); Foster, Bob, Determinants of Pro-Environmental Behaviour in the Workplace, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 8, (2022); Ercantan, Ozlem, How Do Green Human Resource Management Practices Encourage Employees to Engage in Green Behavior?

Subsequently, they have implemented various measures and adopted multiple approaches to attain these goals. Academic research has given due attention to firms' efforts in this direction. However, past studies have primarily focused on non-digital and process-oriented approaches to achieving CN, with the potential of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) remaining less explored. Our study aims to address this gap by qualitatively examining the use of AI for pursuing CN, drawing insights from firms with prior experience in the area. We analyzed the collected qualitative data to identify four key dimensions that capture different nuances of applying AI for achieving CN: (a) implementing AI for direct and indirect control of emissions, (b) accepting the strategic trade-offs related to funding, data and systems concerns, and social priorities, (c) overcoming organizational and human-related impediments, and (d) acknowledging the significant impact of AI in terms of gains in business model efficiency and measurable CN target attainment, which ultimately contribute to CN. Based on our findings, we propose a convergence–divergence model encompassing the positive aspects, inhibiting factors, synergies, and offsets necessary for firms to leverage AI to achieve net-zero emissions effectively. Overall, our study contributes to the discourse on the utilization of AI for CN in a comprehensive manner.","Artificial Intelligence; Carbon Emission; Carbon Neutrality; Digital Technologies; Energy Management; Regulatory Mandates; Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Social Responsibility; Innovation; Qualitative Analysis; Regulatory Approach; Technological Change; Technological Development","artificial intelligence; corporate social responsibility; innovation; qualitative analysis; regulatory approach; technological change; technological development","Information This research was supported by Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China (21AGL014); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong\u2014Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515011894); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20210324093208022); Shenzhen University Humanities and Social Sciences High-level Innovation Team Project for Leading Scholars (24LJXZ06).First and second authors are supported by Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China (21AGL014); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong\u2014Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515011894); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20210324093208022); Shenzhen University Humanities and Social Sciences High-level Innovation Team Project for Leading Scholars (24LJXZ06).

This paper addresses this gap by employing an exploratory single-case study methodology to investigate the intricate process through which an ecological restoration enterprise in China updates its digital strategy, facilitating the dynamic evolution of its digital capabilities from a resource orchestration theory perspective. Our findings reveal a sequential evolution from digital strategy renewal to resource orchestration and, ultimately, the advancement of digital capabilities. Specifically, the enterprise engages in a co-adjustment and co-creation process, aligning its resources with a digital strategy refresh and fostering the emergence of digital integration and innovation capabilities through effective resource management. This includes the accumulation and divesting of resources as part of the construction process, alongside the enrichment and bundling of resources. This research bridges the gap in the current literature by providing a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of digital capabilities, and it offers a theoretical framework that integrates strategic renewal with resource orchestration for environmental and socio-economic sustainable development. Furthermore, the insights gained provide vital managerial implications for the governance, corporate social responsibility and policy of industrial digitalization towards global environmental practice and sustainable development goals (SDGs).","Digital Transformation; Digitalization Capabilities; Environmental Practice; Resource Orchestration; Strategic Renewal; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Bridges; Ecology; Economic And Social Effects; Restoration; Case-studies; Digital Strategies; Digital Transformation; Digitalization Capability; Dynamic Evolution; Ecological Restoration; Environmental Practices; Resource Orchestration; Strategic Renewal; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Development","Bridges; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Restoration; Case-studies; Digital strategies; Digital transformation; Digitalization capability; Dynamic evolution; Ecological restoration; Environmental practices; Resource orchestration; Strategic renewal; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable development","This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (19BGL187)","Adner, Ron, Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 10 SPEC ISS., pp. 1011-1025, (2003); Adner, Ron, What is different about digital strategy?

However, information is scarce on the ways of optimizing the strategies for forestry and environmental education and awareness in many developing countries. Using a literature review and document content analysis, this study explores the case of four forested ecosystems in Kenya with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of the strategies to achieve sustainable forest management. Results show that the key ingredients of effective forestry and environmental education are formal education infrastructure, community engagement panels, digital platforms, corporate responsibility initiatives, media, arts, policy advocacy, and research with feedback loops on initiatives. Kenya is desirous of establishing robust mechanisms for effective environmental education and awareness, as demonstrated by policy and legal actions. Case studies of Cherangany, Mt. Kenya, Aberdares, and Kakamega forest ecosystems demonstrate these commendable efforts by embedding the ingredients of effective strategy optimization within their forest ecosystem management plans. However, there is a need to revise the expired Kakamega, Mt. Kenya, and Aberdare ecosystem management plans and optimize awareness strategies by leveraging the existing educational infrastructure and increasing stakeholder engagement, especially activating the role of county governments and addressing outstanding challenges currently inhibiting sustainable forest management.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Resource Management; Stakeholder Collaboration; Sustainable Forest Management","","This research was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020S1A5C2A01092978).","Aberdare Ecosystem Management Plan 2020 2020; Role of the Ministry of Education in Enhancing Environmental Conservation in Southern Palestinian Governorates; Palgrave Encyclopedia of Urban and Regional Futures, (2025); Berlyn, Graeme Pierce, Some Thoughts on Mountain Forests: Their Benefits and Sustainability, Journal of Sustainable Forestry, 42, 10, pp. 961-966, (2023); Breiting, Søren, The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark, Environmental Education Research, 16, 1, pp. 9-37, (2010); Bülbül, Hasan, The relationship between environmental awareness, environmental behaviors, and carbon footprint in Turkish households, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 20, pp. 25009-25028, (2020); Chankrajang, Thanyaporn, Green Returns to Education: Does Schooling Contribute to Pro-Environmental Behaviours?

This paper explores the SPCR effect of DT, as well as its mechanism at micro-firm level. The study found that: (1) DT significantly facilitates corporate SPCR. For every 10% increase in the level of DT, the ranking of SPCR will rise by about 2.3 places. This effect is more obvious in high-tech firms and non-heavy polluters, firms in the eastern region in China, and non-SOE. (2) DT creates innovation-driven and structure-optimizing effects, which enhance the corporate green innovation ability, optimize the business structure and capital allocation structure of enterprises, and then drive the SPCR. (3) External public environmental concerns (PEC) and internal corporate ESG governance act as “accelerators” promoting the SPCR effect of DT. Based on these, policy implications are made to accelerate the pace of corporate DT, give full play to the first-mover advantage, and break the “pollution (carbon) lock-in” with a view to providing theoretical references for the listed enterprises' digitalized governance of SPCR, as well as the governmental departments' formulation of relevant guiding policies, and striving to achieve the high-quality development goal.","Digital Transformation; Environmental Concerns; Green Innovation; Structural Optimization; Synergies For Pollution And Carbon Reduction; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon; Mergers And Acquisitions; Public Policy; Carbon Reduction; Corporates; Digital Transformation; Environmental Concerns; Green Innovations; Micro-enterprises; Pollution Reduction; Reduction Effects; Structural Optimisations; Synergy For Pollution And Carbon Reduction; Structural Optimization; Carbon; Business Development; Carbon Emission; Emission Control; Innovation; Optimization; Pollution Control; Transformation; Air Pollution Control; Article; China; Cloud Computing; Coping; Digital Technology; Digitization; Energy Consumption; Environmental Policy; Environmental Protection; Information Technology; Social Responsibility; Sustainable Development; Chemistry; Pollution; Prevention And Control; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution","Carbon; Mergers and acquisitions; Public policy; Carbon reduction; Corporates; Digital transformation; Environmental concerns; Green innovations; Micro-enterprises; Pollution reduction; Reduction effects; Structural optimisations; Synergy for pollution and carbon reduction; Structural optimization; carbon; business development; carbon emission; emission control; innovation; optimization; pollution control; transformation; air pollution control; Article; China; cloud computing; coping; digital technology; digitization; energy consumption; environmental policy; environmental protection; information technology; social responsibility; sustainable development; chemistry; pollution; prevention and control; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution","This study is sponsored by the National Social Science Fund of China ( 23CGL043 ), the Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( 23EYC001 ) and the National Statistical Science Research Program ( 2023LZ021 ).","Adhikari, Binay Kumar, Peer influence on payout policies, Journal of Corporate Finance, 48, pp. 615-637, (2018); Ahmadova, Gozal, Too good to be true: The inverted U-shaped relationship between home-country digitalization and environmental performance, Ecological Economics, 196, (2022); Ahmed, Aminu Adamu, Analysing the issues surrounding information and communication technology penetration and growth, Managerial and Decision Economics, 44, 2, pp. 716-732, (2023); Akimoto, Keigo, Impacts of ride and car-sharing associated with fully autonomous cars on global energy consumptions and carbon dioxide emissions, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 174, (2022); Allcott, Hunt, The welfare effects of social media†, American Economic Review, 110, 3, pp. 629-676, (2020); Direct and Indirect Effects of Citizen Participation on Environmental Governance in China, (2022); Chatterjee, Sheshadri, Understanding AI adoption in manufacturing and production firms using an integrated TAM-TOE model, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 170, (2021); Meng-Tao, Chen, How does ESG disclosure improve stock liquidity for enterprises — Empirical evidence from China, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 98, (2023); Chen, Shaojian, Low-Carbon City Construction and Corporate Carbon Reduction Performance: Evidence From a Quasi-Natural Experiment in China, Journal of Business Ethics, (2021); Chu, Zhaopeng, How can public participation improve environmental governance in China?

The term ""responsible consumption""has no clear category boundaries in the scientific literature. However, most authors emphasise the number of additional requirements in the entire product value chain emergence such as production technologies; corporate social responsibility programs; business processes transparency as well as their ethics; packaging specifics; certification availability; raw materials; and product performance characteristics. Digitalisation and development of the responsible consumers segment have a great impact on the business environment changing, contributing to the emergence of new market niches and ecological products, as well as other opportunities and risks. Business leaders need recommendations for adapting existing marketing strategies in the direction of building marketing ecosystems and new formats of communicating with the consumer. The paper describes a full range of digital marketing communications tools for interacting with responsible consumption followers. The authors propose to use influence-marketing to broadcast corporate values and key ideas of sustainable brand as well as its ecological image to the target audience.

The concept of responsibility, as expressed in terms such as corporate social responsibility or responsible research and innovation, represents one well-established discourse and a set of practices that are used to deal with social and ethical concerns and which are now a well-established part of the broader sustainability literature. Recently, a novel discourse has gained prominence that specifically explores the question of which responsibilities arise for organisations based on their engagement with digital technologies. This discourse uses the term ‘corporate digital responsibility’ to describe how organisations can understand, shape, and discharge their responsibilities not just in a narrow economic sense, but also their broader moral, social and environmental responsibilities. This article takes its point of departure from the corporate digital responsibility discussion and aims to contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of the term. This article suggests that an appropriate metaphor to approach the reality of current socio-technical systems is that of an “ecosystem”. This metaphor accommodates many of the systems features of contemporary digital technologies, but it clashes with traditional conceptions of responsibility. This article argues that a concept of responsible digital ecosystems is a precondition for the successful ascription of responsibilities in digital contexts. Such ecosystems can be understood as systems that are designed to foster and support existing and novel responsibilities, that align responsibility ascriptions with a view to achieve desirable and acceptable outcomes. Based on these ideas of responsible digital ecosystems, this article spells out some of the implications for research and practice that the adoption of this conceptual framework entails.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Responsibility; Innovation Ecosystem; Responsible (research And) Innovation; Responsible Digital Ecosystem; Conceptual Framework; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Strategy; Digitization; Innovation; Sustainability","conceptual framework; corporate social responsibility; corporate strategy; digitization; innovation; sustainability","Funding text 1: This discourse is of interest here because it takes a novel perspective on responsibility. In their seminal paper Stilgoe, Owen and Macnaghten [] highlight four dimensions that they see as crucial for R(R)I: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness, thus underlining the communicative and reciprocal nature of responsibility. These ideas have proven to be highly influential in the field of research governance and in particular research funding, becoming adopted by the UK\u2019s Engineering and Physical Science Research Council [] and they now form part of guidance for all research funded by UK Research and Innovation. These principles have been further developed with a specific focus on digital technologies []. There is a closely related but not fully identical discourse that covers these topics of research and innovation governance on the EU funding level which has led to the somewhat confusing acronym R(R)I []. For the purposes of this article, we can ignore the fine points of this debate and see it as \u201Cthe on-going process of aligning research and innovation to the values, needs and expectations of society\u201D [].

Digital-platform-based ecosystems’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities have become a vital tool to support humans during crises. However, little is known about the impact of the innovative CSR practices of digital-platform-based ecosystems during a crisis. Therefore, this study investigates this crucial question. Building on dynamic capabilities theory and using thematic analysis of 89 news articles and data from website sources and reports relating to Airbnb Inc.’s CSR innovation in the Afghan 2021 and the Russia–Ukraine 2022 humanitarian crises, we find that strategic digital-platform-based ecosystem-driven CSR interventions during crises can be helpful for society and for businesses.

To remain resilient in this dynamic market environment, supply chains must evolve through iterative upgrades and transition to a higher level of sustainability, a process termed “step development.” The current literature, however, offers limited insights into achieving such step development in supply chain sustainability and its critical supporting elements. This study, grounded in theory, involved interviews with representatives from eight diverse Chinese enterprises. We introduce a model delineating supporting factors and a roadmap for Sustainable Step Development of Supply Chains (SSDSC). Our findings highlight three pivotal categories of support for SSDSC: institutional, technological, and social factors. Additionally, we observed that external influences in these categories positively modulate their internal counterparts. The study identifies industrial technology, digital intelligence technology, corporate responsibility, and stakeholder needs as key elements in this process. We conclude by offering theoretical and practical recommendations to foster SSDSC.","Grounded Theory; Supply Chain; Supporting Factors; Sustainable Development","","This paper is a phased research achievement of the Major Program of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (Grant No. 2022-JB-01).

This study examines the effects of corporate digitalization on green transformation within resource-based firms listed in China from 2009 to 2021. The analysis reveals that digital transformation substantially enhances the sustainability of these enterprises. Nonetheless, the effects are not uniform across all sectors: they are more pronounced in mining-based companies, large entities, and businesses operating in the central and western regions of China. In contrast, impacts appear negligible for energy production and supply companies, smaller firms, and enterprises based in the central regions. The robustness of these findings is confirmed through various methodological adjustments, including variations in the explanatory variables, adjustments to the study's sample size, the inclusion of additional control variables, and the application of diverse empirical models. Finally, we further finds that internal and external factors such as increased corporate social responsibility, increased media attention, and financialization support can contribute to the greening effect of digital transformation on resource-based enterprises.","China; Digital Transformation; Green Innovation; Mineral Resources; Resource-based Enterprises; Competition; Mineral Resources; China; Digital Economy; Digital Transformation; Green Innovations; Growth Areas; Industrial Transformations; Path Analysis; Resource-based Enterprise; Resources Based; Resources Consumption; Regression Analysis; Competitiveness; Corporate Social Responsibility; Empirical Analysis; Mineral Resource; Path Analysis; Sustainability","Competition; Mineral resources; China; Digital economy; Digital transformation; Green innovations; Growth areas; Industrial transformations; Path analysis; Resource-based enterprise; Resources based; Resources consumption; Regression analysis; competitiveness; corporate social responsibility; empirical analysis; mineral resource; path analysis; sustainability","The improvement of CSR, the increase of media attention, and the support of financialization play a positive moderating role in the digital transformation of enterprises to promote the green development of RBE. CSR is the responsibility for the environment and other stakeholders in business activities, of which environmental responsibility is an essential part. Corporate digital transformation, on the other hand, refers to economic activities that rely on digital technologies. The digitalization of enterprises can reduce RBE' material production and energy consumption, and the impact on the environment will be reduced accordingly. In the development process of enterprise digital transformation, enterprises still need to bear environmental responsibility. It can not completely replace the material economy, so enterprises must improve their social responsibility level to ensure sustainable development continuously. Specifically, CSR can inspire enterprises to innovate and develop green technologies and products. As customer demand for green products increases, corporate products that meet environmental standards will be more competitive (Abbas, 2020). CSR can only be recognized and practiced within the enterprise to ensure the quality and environmental friendliness of products from the source. In this way, RBE will strengthen their focus on green innovation and develop more green products. In this process, the technological advantages of enterprise digital transformation can provide enterprises with more innovative ideas and solutions. Moreover, by improving CSR, enterprises can better understand the public's and other stakeholders' needs, strengthen their ability to coordinate with other stakeholders and unify their goals toward sustainable development. Through CSR enhancement, RBE can develop more green solutions based on the digital transformation of enterprises, and CSR enhancement can improve the image and trust of enterprises in the eyes of the public and customers (Alam and Islam, 2021). With the increase in recognition and trust, firms will be rewarded with more sales and market expansion, which will help the digital transformation of firms to promote the green development of resource-based firms.","Abbas, Jawad, Impact of total quality management on corporate green performance through the mediating role of corporate social responsibility, Journal of Cleaner Production, 242, (2020); International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2021); Algieri, Bernardina, The Dutch Disease: Evidences from Russia, Economic Change and Restructuring, 44, 3, pp. 243-277, (2011); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Barbier, Edward B., The evolution of economic views on natural resource scarcity, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 15, 1, pp. 24-44, (2021); Bertani, Filippo, The complexity of the intangible digital economy: an agent-based model, Journal of Business Research, 129, pp. 527-540, (2021); Bertilsson, Jonas, Discourses on transformational change and paradigm shift in the Green Climate Fund: the divide over financialization and country ownership, Environmental Politics, 30, 3, pp. 423-441, (2021); Bhandari, Krishna Raj, The resource-based view, stakeholder capitalism, ESG, and sustainable competitive advantage: The firm's embeddedness into ecology, society, and governance, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 4, pp. 1525-1537, (2022); Bonnet, Didier C.L., The new elements of digital transformation, MIT Sloan Management Review, 62, 2, pp. 83-89, (2021); Brunel, Claire, Green innovation and green Imports:Links between environmental policies, innovation, and production, Journal of Environmental Management, 248, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","03014207","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193900960"

The study finds a significant inverted U-shaped correlation between the level of corporate digital transformation and the degree of carbon information disclosure. Specifically, in the nascent phase of digital transformation, enhancing the degree of transformation can facilitate the enhancement of carbon information disclosure. However, when digital transformation goes too far, the negative effects will overweight the positive ones, and level of carbon information disclosure will be inhibited. The analysis indicates that a high level of persistent green innovation capability can positively moderate the effect of corporate digitization on carbon information disclosure. That is to say, a strong persistent green innovation capability can reinforce the beneficial impact of digitization on the level of carbon information disclosure. When the persistent capability for green innovation improves and surpasses a certain threshold, it can convert the right side of the inverted U-shaped curve into a U-shaped curve. This allows for persistent improvement in the level of carbon information disclosure through further digital transformation. Further analysis indicates that enhancing internal control levels and knowledge integration capabilities can also postpone the occurrence of the inflection point on the inverted U-shaped curve.","Carbon Information Disclosure; Digital Transformation; Internal Control; Inverted U-curve; Knowledge Integration; Persistent Green Innovation","","","Akbas, Halil Emre, Determinants of voluntary greenhouse gas emission disclosure: An empirical investigation on Turkish firms, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 1, (2019); Akerman, Anders, The skill complementarity of broadband internet, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, 4, pp. 1781-1824, (2015); Amran, Azlan Bin, Determinants of climate change disclosure by developed and emerging countries in asia pacific, Sustainable Development, 22, 3, pp. 188-204, (2014); Ben-Amar, Walid, Board Effectiveness and the Voluntary Disclosure of Climate Change Information, Business Strategy and the Environment, 24, 8, pp. 704-719, (2015); Bewley, Kathryn, Disclosure of environmental information by Canadian manufacturing companies: A voluntary disclosure perspective, Advances in Environmental Accounting and Management, 1, pp. 201-226, (2000); Deegan, Craig Michael, The materiality of environmental information to users of annual reports, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 10, 4, pp. 562-583, (1997); Dong, John Qi, Information technology and external search in the open innovation age: New findings from Germany, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 120, pp. 223-231, (2017); González-González, José M., Voluntary carbon disclosure by Spanish companies: an empirical analysis, International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, 8, 1, pp. 57-79, (2016); Green, Wendy J., An International Examination of Assurance Practices on Carbon Emissions Disclosures, Australian Accounting Review, 23, 1, pp. 54-66, (2013); Griffin, Paul A., The Relevance to Investors of Greenhouse Gas Emission Disclosures, Contemporary Accounting Research, 34, 2, pp. 1265-1297, (2017)","","Elsevier Inc.","10590560","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189983696"

This study employs the Heckman two-stage model to examine the impact of ESG performance on innovation novelty using a dataset comprising A-share listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2011 to 2020. The results indicate that enhanced ESG performance significantly fosters innovation by expanding innovation resources and mitigating agency problems. Further analysis reveals that this relationship is more pronounced under high economic policy uncertainty, a challenging information environment, elevated financing constraints, and in the context of digital transformation. This study not only expands the research on the economic implications of ESG performance for enterprise innovation behavior but also places a distinct emphasis on innovation quality rather than quantity. Additionally, this study enriches the existing literature on the factors influencing innovation novelty and extends research into the link between environmental protection and firm innovation, particularly from the perspective of stakeholder theory. Furthermore, this study holds practical significance for governments aiming to enhance ESG evaluation systems and establish guiding policies that encourage novel innovations, ultimately contributing to sustainable and high-quality development. Simultaneously, this study provides guidance to enterprises by encouraging them to embrace green development, improve social responsibility, and elevate their governance standards to promote innovation quality.","Agency Problem; Esg; Innovation Novelty; Innovation Quality; Resource Dependence Theory; Sustainable Development","","Funding text 1: Wanyi Chen acknowledges the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72102139).; Funding text 2: Wanyi Chen acknowledges the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 72102139).

Using data from A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020, we test our hypothesis and find that CSR facilitates digital transformation of firms and that the effect is persistent. Mechanism tests show that CSR promotes digital transformation only by improving firms' human and technological resources.

Design/methodology/approach: The study applies the event study method and cross-sectional regression analysis, taking 168 digital technology innovations for social responsibility issued by 88 listed platform enterprises from 2011 to 2022 to study the impact of digital technology innovations for social responsibility announcements of different announcement content and platform attributes on the stock market value of platform enterprises. Findings: The results show that, first, the positive stock market reaction is produced on the same day as the digital technology innovation announcement. Second, the announcement of the platform’s public social responsibility and the announcement of co-innovation and radical innovation bring more positive stock market reactions. In addition, the announcements mentioned above issued by trading platforms bring more positive stock market reactions. Finally, the social responsibility attribution characteristics of the announcement did not have a significant differentiated impact on the stock market reaction. Originality/value: Most scholars have studied digital technology innovation for social responsibility through modeling rather than second-hand data to empirically examine. This study uses second-hand data with the instrumental stakeholder theory to provide a new research perspective on platform social responsibility. In addition, in order to explore the different impacts of digital technology innovation on social responsibility, this study has classified digital technology innovation for social responsibility according to its social responsibility and digital technology innovation characteristics.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technology Innovation; Event Study; Shareholder Value; Commerce; Economic And Social Effects; Regression Analysis; Shareholders; Social Aspects; Corporate Social Responsibility; Design/methodology/approach; Digital Technologies; Digital Technology Innovation; Event Studies; Market Reactions; Platform Enterprise; Shareholder Values; Social Responsibilities; Technology Innovation; Financial Markets","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Regression analysis; Shareholders; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibility; Design/methodology/approach; Digital technologies; Digital technology innovation; Event studies; Market reactions; Platform enterprise; Shareholder values; Social responsibilities; Technology innovation; Financial markets","This research is funded by Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 22&ZD139).

Compared with formal environmental regulations that force companies to carry out green innovation passively, ESG ratings under soft environmental regulations can better stimulate the internal motivation of companies. This study uses the ESG ratings of listed companies published for the first time by SynTao Green Finance as an exogenous impact. Taking China's A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2022 as a research sample, the multi-period differences-in-differences model was used to empirically test the impact of ESG rating soft supervision on corporate green technology innovation. The results show that the impact of ESG rating events as a soft market regulation has a significant positive impact on the improvement of corporate green technology innovation. This conclusion still holds after a series of robustness tests. Meanwhile, enterprise digital transformation plays a positive regulatory role. The heterogeneity test shows that the green technology innovation of state-owned enterprises is more affected by ESG ratings. Mechanism research has found that ESG rating events promote corporate green technology innovation by easing corporate financing constraints and reducing managerial myopia. Further research found that under the influence of the external environment, intensified market competition and increased attention from the capital market are also conducive to the improvement of corporate green technology innovation. This study strengthens the corporate ESG concept under the guidance of green development and provides empirical evidence for promoting corporate green transformation.","Corporate Digital Transformation; Corporate Green Technology Innovation; Esg Rating; Financing Constraints; Managerial Myopia; Commerce; Competition; Environmental Regulations; Investments; Corporate Digital Transformation; Corporate Green Technology Innovation; Corporates; Digital Transformation; Esg Rating; Financing Constraints; Green Technology; Managerial Myopia; Technology Innovation; Environmental Technology; Capital Market; Green Economy; Heterogeneity; Innovation; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Article; Benchmarking; Carbon Emission; China; Consensus; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Corporate Finance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technology; Empiricism; Environment Society And Governance; Environmental Policy; Epidemic; Explanatory Variable; Financial Management; Government; Green Chemistry; Human; Information Asymmetry; Intrinsic Motivation; Investment; Model; Organization; Public Opinion; Research; Risk; Sampling; Stock Market; Sustainable Development; Environmental Protection; Invention; Procedures; Technology; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Inventions; Technology","Commerce; Competition; Environmental regulations; Investments; Corporate digital transformation; Corporate green technology innovation; Corporates; Digital transformation; ESG rating; Financing constraints; Green technology; Managerial myopia; Technology innovation; Environmental technology; capital market; green economy; heterogeneity; innovation; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; benchmarking; carbon emission; China; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; corporate finance; corporate social responsibility; digital technology; empiricism; Environment Society and Governance; environmental policy; epidemic; explanatory variable; financial management; government; green chemistry; human; information asymmetry; intrinsic motivation; investment; model; organization; public opinion; research; risk; sampling; stock market; sustainable development; environmental protection; invention; procedures; technology; Conservation of Natural Resources; Inventions; Technology","","Ahmed, Zahoor, How do green energy technology investments, technological innovation, and trade globalization enhance green energy supply and stimulate environmental sustainability in the G7 countries?, Gondwana Research, 112, pp. 105-115, (2022); Avetisyan, Emma, The Consolidation of the ESG Rating Industry as an Enactment of Institutional Retrogression, Business Strategy and the Environment, 26, 3, pp. 316-330, (2017); Beck, Thorsten, Big bad banks?

Studies in the field of digital technology and circular economy (CE) have pointed out inherent tensions involved in the adoption of technology and CE practices. Firms often prioritise competing goals and prefer one over another, thereby underestimating their interdependent co-existing relationships. In this context, the study addresses the following research questions: How does digital orientation facilitate digital eco-innovation for CE-linked sustainable development goals (SDGs)? What paradoxes do firms encounter while using digital eco-innovation for CE-linked SDG practices? What possible strategies could be used to overcome the various paradoxes associated with adopting digital eco-innovation for CE-linked SDG practices?. Drawing from the paradox theory and using the SAP-LAP model of inquiry, the study addresses research questions by applying a case study approach. The findings of a qualitative case study provide a novel perspective on digital eco-innovation and CE literature. Unlike previous studies that deal with digital eco-innovation and CE independently, the study primarily contributes to the literature by understanding how digital orientation contributes to digital eco-innovation and the role of digital eco-innovation in CE practices in the context of SDGs.","Circular Economy; Digital Capability; Digital Eco-innovation; Digital Technology; Sustainable Development Goals; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Innovation; Management Practice; Sustainable Development; Technology Adoption","corporate social responsibility; digitization; innovation; management practice; sustainable development; technology adoption","To support digital innovation, XYZ Ltd. started funding start‐ups to bring cutting‐edge and innovative solutions in engineering, logistics, marketing & sales, production and information technology to improve the existing solutions and bring overall business value.

As previous research focused on responding to specific crises, there have been theoretical and practical gaps in the role of CFO. The study's goal is to fill a critical gap by developing a comprehensive and integrated set of roles to assist the CFO in a constantly changing environment. Design/methodology/approach: Using a grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted with 21 CFOs from various industries in Thailand, including foreign multinational corporations and domestic companies with international operations. CFOs were asked how they frame their roles in the face of an ever-changing environment and how they prepare for the future. Findings: The iCFO model is developed, which identifies the critical “core” roles of the CFO in securing the business foundation, as well as the “future opportunities” roles that function as growth engines for long-term business strength. The research delves into the importance of integrity, ethical mindset and corporate governance in the role of the CFO. The iCFO model is designed to help guide future research and provide practical applications for CFOs in both domestic and international contexts. The term “core” refers to the CFO’s primary responsibilities, which include driving profitability, managing risks and optimizing business performance. The “future opportunities” component focuses on the roles that CFOs can play in strengthening the future of business by optimizing investment efficiency, driving digital transformation and being the CEO’s business partner. The findings also emphasized “integrity,” which must encompass all decisions, actions or recommendations made by the CFO. Originality/value: The study offers unique perspectives on an emerging economy, providing new insights. Through interviews with 21 CFOs, it contributes empirical evidence on the development of roles in accounting and finance, emphasizing good governance practices. The findings highlight the integrated role of the CFO and their self-reflection on their value within the company. Significantly, the study's implications are relevant and applicable to a global audience, particularly in developing economies that prioritize growth. Future studies could incorporate integrated thinking into the iCFO model to address social, environmental and economic factors, making it more universally relevant. Additionally, exploring the adoption of the chief value officer context in developing markets could enable CFOs to expand their focus beyond financial metrics, embracing a comprehensive approach to value creation. By integrating these concepts into the iCFO model, CFOs can effectively drive sustainable and impactful business outcomes on a global scale.","Corporate Governance; Financial Management; Financial Reporting; Gioia Method; Grounded Theory; Icfo Model; Integrity; Qualitative Research; Qualitative Study","","","von Alberti-Alhtaybat, Larissa, A knowledge management and sharing business model for dealing with disruption: The case of Aramex, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 400-407, (2019); Baiyere, Abayomi, Digital transformation and the new logics of business process management, European Journal of Information Systems, 29, 3, pp. 238-259, (2020); Becker, Thomas E., Integrity in organizations: Beyond honesty and conscientiousness, Academy of Management Review, 23, 1, pp. 154-161, (1998); Boddy, Clive Roland P., Sample size for qualitative research, Qualitative Market Research, 19, 4, pp. 426-432, (2016); Brewster, Billy E., Do Stronger Wise-Thinking Dispositions Facilitate Auditors' Objective Evaluation of Evidence When Assessing and Addressing Fraud Risk?*, Contemporary Accounting Research, 38, 3, pp. 1679-1711, (2021); Broekhuizen, Thijs L.J., Introduction to the special issue – Digital business models: A multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder perspective, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 847-852, (2021); Brubacher, Sonja P., Information Gathering in Investigative and Medical Interviewing: Drawing Parallels Across Contexts, Health Communication, 36, 4, pp. 521-528, (2021); Brühne, Alissa I., Defining and Managing Corporate Tax Risk: Perceptions of Tax Risk Experts*, Contemporary Accounting Research, 39, 4, pp. 2861-2902, (2022); Chatpibal, Manoj, The Development of Qualitative Research Instruments to Explore the Role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO), ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 69-74, (2022); Chenhall, Robert H., The role of management control systems in planned organizational change: An analysis of two organizations, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 32, 7-8, pp. 601-637, (2007)","","Emerald Publishing","2049372X; 20493738","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171287282"

Growing competition, sharing economy, digital transformation, corporate environmental responsibility, and increasing customer requirements exert pressure on enterprises to change their business mentality. One can easily observe the need for integrated, environment-friendly solutions that generate new value added to customers. To achieve that, we need new business models that would allow to discover new potential in new markets. In the face of dynamic market changes, traditional business models are increasingly less capable of addressing the growing competition, sharing economy, digital transformation, corporate environmental responsibility, and the rising demands of customers. There is a clear need for integrated, environmentally friendly solutions that generate new added value for customers. Achieving this goal requires the development of new business models that enable the discovery of potential in new markets. Therefore, searching for and creating new business models that would stand up to requirements is vital. These problems could be solved by a PSS considered a personalized business model operating in an extended time horizon. PSS is an opportunity to sell product functions and availability, as well as a perspective for multiple uses of products. This paper presents a pioneering attempt to develop a Product-Service System (PSS) business model specifically tailored for the plastics industry. An innovative approach consists in the integration of a machinery and a tool into a production unit and adding an array of services to it. This groundbreaking research, unprecedented in its scale, involved a comprehensive questionnaire-based study conducted across 60 plastics processing plants employing prevalent production techniques. The study is unique in its extensive scope and depth, as such an analysis of PSS business models within the plastics industry has not been previously explored in the open literature. The research methodology applied is thorough, covering a wide range of practical aspects crucial for the effective implementation of PSS in the plastics sector. This paper stands out for its detailed examination of 60 enterprises in the plastics industry, focusing on their interest in 95 services essential for the optimal operation of plastics processing plants and their engagement with representatives from the plastics industry. This extensive study offers valuable insights into the usage of machines and tools in plastics processing, as well as the specific needs, requirements, and challenges faced by businesses in this sector. Results of analyses demonstrate that interest in services differs depending on the size of an enterprise, processing technique, having a toolroom or not, product range, and the duration of breakdowns. A new PSS business model for plastics processing was built based on the analysis of PSS design methods and sectors to which they are addressed, PSS used in practice, plastics processing sector, questionnaire-based studies conducted among plastics processing plants, statistical analyses, advice and consultancy sessions with experts from the investigated industry, finances and trade patterns for machines. Until to date the question of precise design of such a business model for the plastics processing sector has neither been examined nor discussed or evidenced. The paper aims to bridge this gap. The approach to the issue was innovative, based on a questionnaire survey and consultations with experts which allowed to faithfully reproduce the current condition of the investigated sector. In addition, each service added on to the production unit underwent a detailed statistical analysis. The hereto presented business model is extremely comprehensive as it can be used in plastics processing plants of different sizes.","Business Model; Plastics Industry; Plastics Processing Machines; Plastics Processing Plants; Plastics Processing Tools; Product-service System (pss); Commerce; Elastomers; Plastic Products; Plastics Industry; Sales; Business Models; Plastic Industry; Plastic Processing Machine; Plastic Processing Plant; Plastic Processing Tool; Plastics Processing; Processing Machines; Processing Plants; Processing Tools; Product-service System; Product-service Systems; Competition","Commerce; Elastomers; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Sales; Business models; Plastic industry; Plastic processing machine; Plastic processing plant; Plastic processing tool; Plastics processing; Processing machines; Processing plants; Processing tools; Product-service system; Product-service systems; Competition","","Adrodegari, Federico, Business Model Innovation: Process and Tools for Service Transformation of Industrial Firms, Procedia CIRP, 64, pp. 103-108, (2017); Ahmad, Arman Hj, Theorizing servitisation for SME performance, International Journal of Financial Research, 10, 5, pp. 66-74, (2019); Alix, Thécle, Product-Service Systems modelling and simulation as a strategic diagnosis tool, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 398, PART 2, pp. 361-368, (2013); Alonso-Rasgado, Teresa, A rapid design process for total care product creation, Journal of Engineering Design, 17, 6, pp. 509-531, (2006); Alonso-Rasgado, Teresa, The design of functional (total care) products, Journal of Engineering Design, 15, 6, pp. 515-540, (2004); Andriankaja, Hery, A method to design integrated product-service systems based on the extended functional analysis approach, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 21, pp. 120-139, (2018); Andriankaja, Hery, A Framework to Design Integrated Product-Service Systems Based on the Extended Functional Analysis Approach, Procedia CIRP, 47, pp. 323-328, (2016); Aurich, J.

To explore the impact and mechanisms of manufacturing enterprises' digital transformation on reducing their carbon emissions, this study uses data from A-share listed manufacturing enterprises on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2019. Employing fixed-effect and mediation models, the empirical analyses yield the following results: (1) Digital transformation positively influences carbon emissions reduction in manufacturing enterprises. (2) The fulfillment of corporate social responsibility and advancement in technological innovation mediate the relationship between digital transformation and carbon emissions reduction. (3) Both internal (redundant resources) and external (government support) factors affect the impact of digital transformation on carbon emissions. Reducing redundant resources and strengthening government support amplify the positive effect of digital transformation, while redundant resources negatively regulate the initial phase of the impact path of “digital transformation - technological innovation–carbon emissions intensity”. (4) Heterogeneity results reveal that digital transformation plays a more significant role in carbon emission reduction for heavy-polluting enterprises and China's central region. Hence, proactive digital transformation promotion is essential for enterprises aiming to achieve the “dual-carbon” goal, with optimization of internal resource integration and government-appropriate support.","Carbon Emission Reduction; Digital Transformation; Internal And External Resources; Social Responsibility Fulfillment; Technological Innovation; Emission Control; Industrial Research; Metadata; Social Aspects; Carbon Emissions; Carbon Emissions Reductions; Digital Transformation; External Resources; Government Supports; Internal Resources; Manufacturing Enterprise; Social Responsibilities; Social Responsibility Fulfillment; Technological Innovation; Carbon","Emission control; Industrial research; Metadata; Social aspects; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Digital transformation; External resources; Government supports; Internal resources; Manufacturing enterprise; Social responsibilities; Social responsibility fulfillment; Technological innovation; Carbon","","Adams, Carol A., Accessibility and functionality of the corporate web site: Implications for sustainability reporting, Business Strategy and the Environment, 15, 4, pp. 275-287, (2006); Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Alarifi, Abdulrahman S.N., Ultra wideband indoor positioning technologies: Analysis and recent advances, Sensors, 16, 5, (2016); Añón Higón, Dolores, ICT and environmental sustainability: A global perspective, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 4, pp. 85-95, (2017); Anser, Muhammad Khalid, Does corporate social responsibility commitment and participation predict environmental and social performance?, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2578-2587, (2020); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

The present research aims to explore the consumer responses to value co-creation in sharing economy such as satisfaction, brand preference and enduring buyer–platform relationships, amid consumer's CSR concerns. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the sharing economy and value co-creation literature and rooted in the stimulus-organism-response framework, an online panel data provider was employed to recruit 393 actual sharing economy consumers from the United States. Empirical analyses are performed using structural equation modeling through Amos, version.27. Findings: Findings confirm that value co-creation intentions contribute to consumers' satisfaction, brand preference and sustainable social relationships in the sharing economy. As expected, heightened concerns of corporate social responsibility (CSR) led to decreased consumer satisfaction with the sharing economy platform.

Despite the growing interest in Waqftech, Malaysian enterprises have not fully embraced this emerging technology because of uncertainty regarding the benefits it offers to contributors. The research incorporates two theoretical frameworks: the electronic data interchange (EDI) model for firms’ technology adoption, and the triple bottom line theory (TBL) for corporate social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative method using a cross-sectional survey design with a five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used. Data was collected from 210 decision-makers representing small and medium-sized enterprises and analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings from this research suggest that Malaysian enterprises are influenced by both corporate and social predictive benefits when using blockchain crowdfunding, but not by environmental benefits. The adoption of blockchain smart contracts does not correlate with predictive environmental benefits because of misconceptions about the disruptive technology’s impact on biological and digital environmental preservation. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on organizational behavior rather than individual users of waqf crowdfunding, and it is limited, primarily focusing within Malaysia and regions with similar waqf structures. Practical implications: The Waqftech framework allows innovative mechanisms for executing corporate waqf investment returns to the intended beneficiaries through the smart contracts’ platform. In addition, this study supports relevant corporate social responsibility and creating shared value technology adoption theories, including EDI and TBL. Aside from this, the study provides empirical implications for waqf management using fintech platforms. Originality/value: This groundbreaking study focuses on creating a Waqftech model for corporate waqf crowdfunding. The results of this study are important for the development of government policies that support the use of Waqftech in charitable fundraising. More research on biological and digital environmental perspectives is proposed to foster investors’ confidence in the visibility of digital tracking and lead to swift investments in future metaverse fundraising platforms.","Blockchain Technology; Corporate Waqf; Crowdfunding; Fintech; Metaverse; Smart Contracts; Waqftech","","","Fintech as A Disruptive Technology for Financial Institutions, (2019); Afroz, Rafia, Factors affecting the intention of the rice farmers to adopt the integrated cash Waqf environmental protection model: An empirical study in kedah Malaysia, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 6, 4, pp. 189-199, (2019); Shirkah Journal of Economics and Business, (2020); Alam, Md Mahmudul, Waqf as a tool for rendering social welfare services in the social entrepreneurship context, Global Journal Al-Thaqafah, 2018, pp. 87-98, (2018); Azrai Azaimi Ambrose, Azniza Hartini, A proposed model for waqf financing public goods and mixed public goods in Malaysia, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 11, 3, pp. 395-415, (2018); Anshari, Muhammad, Financial technology and disruptive innovation in business: Concept and application, International Journal of Asian Business and Information Management, 11, 4, pp. 29-43, (2020); Auinger, Andreas, Blockchain and trust: Refuting some widely-held misconceptions, (2018); Ayedh, Abdullah Mohammed, Malaysian Muslim investors’ behaviour towards the blockchain-based Bitcoin cryptocurrency market, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 12, 4, pp. 690-704, (2020); International Review of Entrepreneurial Finance, (2019); Bakar, Muhammad Fauzan Abu, Adoption of sustainable technology in the Malaysian SMEs sector: Does the role of government matter?, Information (Switzerland), 11, 4, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","17590841; 17590833","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184884906"

The concept of corporate voice – the “voice” of the organisation – is problematised to explore tensions in vocality. The aim is to support communication practitioners to navigate multi-vocality in the evolving professional context of digital communication technologies and changes in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study considers the role of voice in corporate communication practices and offers insights into “digital disruption” and the discursive pressure of employers' priorities on the profession and its practices. Job advertisements for internal communication practitioners were examined during 6-month periods in 2018, 2020 and 2022, which was a significant time of change for the profession with the global COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Qualitative content analysis of 514 internal communication job advertisements identifies that control and consistency are valorised, and continue to dominate descriptions of internal communication skills and responsibilities. The digital affordances that communication practitioners rely on has not changed significantly and a preference for “broadcasting” is evident. Originality/value: This study provides insights into how Australian organisations shape and sustain univocal corporate communication practices, and the incompatibility of narrow configurations of voice with emerging organisational challenges such as social connectedness.","Corporate Voice; Digital Affordances; Digital Disruption; Employee Engagement; Hybrid Working; Multi-vocality; Univocality","","","Internal Communications Specialist, (2022); Internal Communications Manager, (2022); Barley, William C., Networks and technology, pp. 233-252, (2019); Beauregard, T.

With this reliance, comes an impetus for firms to responsibly and ethically manage their digital assets and data. In response, Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) has been espoused as a means by which firms can address the competing demands of digital innovation and transformation and ethical responsibility. Ultimately, good CDR practices have the potential to safeguard not only firms, but the various stakeholders they interact with across their digital ecosystems. However, it is recognized that the resource investment required to do so, can come at a significant cost. The CDR Calculus has been developed to assist organizations in evaluating the risks and benefits associated with digital and data practices and to determine whether they align with the organization's CDR objectives. This paper provides a roadmap of how firms can take steps to establish a culture of CDR practice in light of these tensions. We also recognize that external regulation is required, if not needed, to enforce and cement positive CDR practices as firms respond to growing digital demands.","Artificial Intelligence; Cdr Calculus; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Data; Digital Ecosystems; Digital Ethics","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","00902616","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192206893"

Finally, the optimal balance strategy for each governing subject, the optimal trajectory of governance volume, and the trajectory of total revenue are obtained. The study found that: 1) Public and user supervision can improve the governance volume while encourage the governance motivation of government agencies and platform corporations. 2) The level of user supervision effort has a greater impact on the total governance revenue than public supervision. 3) The revenue of the system and the governance volume are greater in a centralized decision-making process, indicating that those involved should co-operate in governance based on the principle of mutual benefit. 4) The platform corporation has an incompatible but unified relationship between its social duty and financial success.","Alienation; Article; Classification; Corporate Social Responsibility; Decision Making; Digital Technology; Economic Aspect; Game; Government; Human; Open Access Publishing; Social Responsibility; Organization And Management; Decision Making; Government Agencies; Humans; Social Responsibility","alienation; article; classification; corporate social responsibility; decision making; digital technology; economic aspect; game; government; human; open access publishing; social responsibility; organization and management; Decision Making; Government Agencies; Humans; Social Responsibility","","Li, Haiting, Corporate social responsibility and crossborder M&A: The moderating effect of institutional distance, PLOS ONE, 17, 1 January, (2022); Carroll, Archie B., The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders, Business Horizons, 34, 4, pp. 39-48, (1991); Matten, Dirk, Implicit"" and ""explicit"" CSR: A conceptual framework for a comparative understanding of corporate social responsibility, Academy of Management Review, 33, 2, pp. 404-424, (2008); Kong, Dongmin, Does corporate social responsibility matter in the food industry?

However, in China, the total cost of occupational pensions is shared between employees and employers, representing a significant financial commitment. This study aimed to explore the effect of the occupational pension on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and organizational resilience. Drawing on insights from cost-stickiness and resource-based theories, we developed a model that elucidated the influence of occupational pensions on firms’ approaches to CSR within the context of COVID-19 and how this, in turn, impacted organizational resilience. This study categorized CSR into strategic and responsive activities, employing the concept of cost stickiness as a framework. We analyzed a sample of 34,145 observations from Chinese A-share listed companies spanning the period 2010–2023 to examine the influence of occupational pension adjustments on CSR strategies. The findings of this study revealed that the cost pressure associated with contributions to occupational pensions prompted firms to decrease their engagement in responsive CSR activities while enhancing their strategic CSR initiatives. Furthermore, it was observed that strategic CSR contributed to improved organizational resilience, whereas responsive CSR did not exhibit the same effect. The relationship between occupational pension contributions and CSR was found to be significantly and negatively moderated by factors such as the minimum wage and population aging. Conversely, the relationship between CSR and organizational resilience was significantly and positively moderated by digital transformation and marketing capabilities.","Aging Population; Digital Transformation; Marketing Capability; Minimum Wage; Occupational Pension; Organizational Resilience","","This study is supported by the Research Project of Macao Polytechnic University (RP/ESCHS-03/2020).","Agarwal, Sumit, Age of decision: Pension savings withdrawal and consumption and debt response, Management Science, 66, 1, pp. 43-69, (2020); Akee, Randall Quinones, Unintended consequences of China's new labor contract law on unemployment and welfare loss of the workers, China Economic Review, 53, pp. 87-105, (2019); Ali, Mohammed Hasan M., Evaluation of selection criteria in Cicer arietinum L. using correlation coefficients and path analysis, Australian Journal of Crop Science, 3, 2, pp. 65-70, (2009); Al-Mamun, Abdullah, Board of director attributes and CSR engagement in emerging economy firms: Evidence from across Asia, Emerging Markets Review, 46, (2021); Anderson, Mark C., Are selling, general, and administrative costs ""sticky""?, Journal of Accounting Research, 41, 1, pp. 47-63, (2003); Andersson, Thomas, Building traits for organizational resilience through balancing organizational structures, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 35, 1, pp. 36-45, (2019); Bai, Chen, New trends in population aging and challenges for China’s sustainable development, China Economic Journal, 13, 1, pp. 3-23, (2020); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Managing responsibly in tough economic times: Strategic and tactical CSR during the 2008-2009 global recession, Long Range Planning, 48, 2, pp. 69-79, (2015); Barnea, Amir, Corporate Social Responsibility as a Conflict Between Shareholders, Journal of Business Ethics, 97, 1, pp. 71-86, (2010); Barta, Gergő, Risk management considerations for artificial intelligence business applications, International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 21, 1, pp. 87-106, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","22279091","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191414706"

Digital transformation contributes to corporate efficiency, while fulfilling corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a non-market-based strategy for companies seeking legitimacy. However, sustainability research remains unclear about the link between digital transformation and CSR and the mechanisms behind it. To fill this research gap, we incorporate economic policy uncertainty (EPU) into our analytical framework and elucidate the theoretical mechanism of the simultaneous bidirectional relationship between digital transformation and CSR from the perspective of organizational legitimacy. We construct a simultaneous equation model and analyze a sample of 468 Chinese listed companies collected from 2011 to 2018 using the three-stage least squares method. Our findings reveal a mutually reinforcing bidirectional relationship between digital transformation and CSR. Furthermore, we discover that EPU weakens the facilitating influence of digital transformation on CSR but strengthens the positive impact of CSR on digital transformation. Our conclusions suggest that companies taking on more CSR in digital transformation contexts can help achieve the organic unity of efficiency and legitimacy for sustainable development, but uncertainty can undermine this positive interaction.","Bidirectional Relationship; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Economic Policy Uncertainty; Sustainability; Analytical Framework; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Economic Policy; Equation; Study Perspective; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","analytical framework; corporate social responsibility; digitization; economic policy; equation; study perspective; sustainability; sustainable development","This research was funded by the Social Science Foundation of Guangdong, grant number GD23YGL06; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, grant number 2022A1515110506.","Schaltegger, Stefan C., In Search of the Dominant Rationale in Sustainability Management: Legitimacy- or Profit-Seeking?, Journal of Business Ethics, 145, 2, pp. 259-276, (2017); Hinings, Bob R.B.H., Digital innovation and transformation: An institutional perspective, Information and Organization, 28, 1, pp. 52-61, (2018); Singh, Shiwangi, Modeling the effects of digital transformation in Indian manufacturing industry, Technology in Society, 67, (2021); Fakhar Manesh, Mohammad, Knowledge Management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Mapping the Literature and Scoping Future Avenues, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 68, 1, pp. 289-300, (2021); Sousa-Zomer, Thayla T., Digital transforming capability and performance: a microfoundational perspective, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 40, 7-8, pp. 1095-1128, (2020); van den Broek, Tijs A., Governance of big data collaborations: How to balance regulatory compliance and disruptive innovation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 129, pp. 330-338, (2018); Mittal, Sameer, A smart manufacturing adoption framework for SMEs, International Journal of Production Research, 58, 5, pp. 1555-1573, (2020); Sage Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, (2008); Suddaby, Roy, Rhetorical strategies of legitimacy, Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, 1, pp. 35-67, (2005); Wang, Heli C., Good deeds done in silence: Stakeholder management and quiet giving by Chinese firms, Organization Science, 32, 3, pp. 649-674, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190151815"

DIF plays a more pronounced role in driving GTI in the eastern and central regions, non-resource cities, second-tier cities, and cities with a higher level of digital economy development and implementation of the broadband China strategy. Digital governance facilitates the efficient implementation of digital finance and fosters a conducive external environment and internal drive for businesses.

By analyzing manually collected data on municipal government official turnovers in China spanning from 2007 to 2020, we discover a notable increase in corporate green investments following these turnovers, aligning with resource dependency theory. The upswing in green investment results from both corporate initiatives and government influence. Companies that intensify green investments after political turnovers enjoy benefits such as reduced taxes and increased subsidies. The impact of political turnovers on green investments becomes more pronounced amid economic and political uncertainties, particularly under externally appointed officials. This effect is most significant in the energy sector and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Despite the observed surge in green investment activity post-turnovers, there is a tendency for these initiatives to subsequently decrease overall firm performance, likely due to the higher costs associated with green investments.

In financial services, there is a broad spectrum of potential ethical issues, from data usage to customer vulnerabilities. This article scrutinizes the impact of morality and where accountability resides in the use of AI service robots in financial services. To address this challenge, we discuss the role of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) for firms and illustrate how to implement a conceptual framework on the ethical implications of AI service robot applications, drawing on normative ethical theory. The framework elaborates on how the locus of morality (from human to AI agency) and moral intensity combine within context-specific AI service robot applications, and how this might influence associated accountability. We provide examples of AI robots’ use for different purposes, differentiating between four 'accountability clusters': (1) professional norms, (2) business responsibility, (3) inter-institutional normativity, and (4) supra-territorial regulations cluster. We also discuss the CDR implications in different clusters.

We link the five AI intelligence types (verbal-linguistic, logic-mathematical, visual-spatial, social, and speed-processing) to CDR strategies to produce value for retailers and consumers. Specifically, we define intelligent retail service automation, emphasizing actions, tools, and (privacy) concerns, and discuss the role of CDR in AI for intelligent retail service by developing the new concept of Artificial Intelligence Responsibility in Retail Service Automation (AIRRSA).

Then, data mining technology is used to crawl the annual report data of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2021. With the help of text mining analysis, this study quantifies the digital transformation of enterprises and empirically analyses the impact of digital transformation on CEP. The results indicate that digital transformation has significantly improved CEP. The evidence remains valid after a series of robustness tests, including replacing core variables, eliminating the impact of external major events, improving sample quality and instrumental variable regression. Mechanism verification shows that Digital transformation (DT) enhances CEP through ‘green technology upgrading’, ‘increasing external media attention’ and ‘enhancing internal management control’ effects. Heterogeneity analysis shows that DT has a more significant positive impact on non-private, industry technology-intensive, high regional environmental regulation, high energy consumption and high emission CEP, Internet business models are less conducive to improving corporate environmental performance than other digital technologies. Further tests show that resource reallocation improves the industry's environmental performance and is an important channel for DT to play a catalytic role.","Corporate Environmental Performance; Digital Technology Heterogeneity; Digital Transformation; Resource Reallocation Effect; Text-mining Analysis; Data Mining; Energy Utilization; Environmental Management; Environmental Technology; Chinese Listed Companies; Corporate Environmental Performance; Data Mining Technology; Digital Technologies; Digital Technology Heterogeneity; Digital Transformation; Resource Reallocation; Resource Reallocation Effect; Text Mining Analysis; Theoretical Modeling; Environmental Regulations; Corporate Social Responsibility; Data Mining; Digitization; Heterogeneity; Numerical Model; Performance Assessment; Theoretical Study; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","Data mining; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Chinese listed companies; Corporate environmental performance; Data mining technology; Digital technologies; Digital technology heterogeneity; Digital transformation; Resource reallocation; Resource reallocation effect; Text mining analysis; Theoretical modeling; Environmental regulations; corporate social responsibility; data mining; digitization; heterogeneity; numerical model; performance assessment; theoretical study; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","Funding text 1: Chongmiao Du is an assistant in Henan Normal University, China.

CSR is related to corporate risk management, as by engaging in CSR activities firms can be more effective in managing stakeholder relationships. Extant studies rarely examine both issues to the level of digital transformation. In the coming years, the issue of digital transformation will have an even bigger impact on business models. The first step in the effective implementation of ERM is the ability of the organization to learn and understand the requirements of ERM implementation in its company. Thus, it is important to examine the effect of the maturity learn element in ERM and CSR as risk management on the level of digital transformation. In addition, this paper also examines the moderating role of CSR on the association between ERM and the level of digital transformation. Our samples consist of manufacturing companies of developed countries in the European Union (which consists of Italy, Spain, Belgium Switzerland, Germany, France, and UK). The paper found evidence that enterprise risk management has a positive significant effect on the level of digital transformation. The paper also found evidence that CSR has a direct effect on the level of digital transformation. However, the paper failed to provide supporting evidence on the moderating role of CSR on the association between ERM and the level of digital transformation.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Enterprise Risk Management; Innovation; Learn Component; Maturity Level","","This study was supported by Universitas Indonesia grant No. NKB‐1441/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020.","Barnea, Amir, Corporate Social Responsibility as a Conflict Between Shareholders, Journal of Business Ethics, 97, 1, pp. 71-86, (2010); State of Risk Oversight an Overview of Enterprise Risk Management Practices, (2025); Becchetti, Leonardo, Corporate social responsibility, stakeholder risk, and idiosyncratic volatility, Journal of Corporate Finance, 35, pp. 297-309, (2015); Bouslah, Kais, The impact of the dimensions of social performance on firm risk, Journal of Banking and Finance, 37, 4, pp. 1258-1273, (2013); Bouslah, Kais, Social Performance and Firm Risk: Impact of the Financial Crisis, Journal of Business Ethics, 149, 3, pp. 643-669, (2018); Sloan Management Review, (1980); Cai, Li, Corporate Environmental Responsibility and Firm Risk, Journal of Business Ethics, 139, 3, pp. 563-594, (2016); Chakraborty, Atreya, Managerial risk taking incentives, corporate social responsibility and firm risk, Journal of Economics and Business, 101, pp. 58-72, (2019); Enterprise Risk Management Framework, (2004); Cronqvist, Henrik, Do entrenched managers pay their workers more?, Journal of Finance, 64, 1, pp. 309-339, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","25723170","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186869818"

In order to remain competitive, enterprises have responded positively to this research and development, which is conducive to the enhancement of their own digital construction. BT can provide technical support for companies to strengthen their internal management and reduce business risks caused by information asymmetry. However, the ability to reduce enterprise financial risk effectively depends on the breadth and depth of BT concerns. This study constructs word-frequency statistical variables of BT concerns based on the annual report data of listed companies. It conducts an empirical study on the issue of BT concerns affecting corporate financial risk prevention and regulation based on a propensity score matching difference-in-difference model. The results show that: (1) Attention to BT significantly reduces corporate financial risk (2) In terms of the mechanism effect, Attention to BT can significantly reduce corporate financial risk by optimizing accounts receivable management, enhancing debt servicing ability, and improving corporate performance. (3) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the concern of BT in reducing financial risk is even more significant for enterprises whose social responsibility is not effectively regulated and for hybrid enterprises. This study enriches the literature on the mechanism of BT to enterprise financial risk and provides a reference for both enterprise-level blockchain concerns and strengthening enterprise financial risk management.","Accounts Receivable Management; Blockchain; Corporate Performance; Financial Risk; Solvency","","This work was supported by the China National Social Science Foundation Project [23BTJ009].","Gerged, Ali Meftah, Does investment stimulate or inhibit CSR transparency?

Recent challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic have further accelerated the need for digital transformation and its effects on consumers. This necessitates an editorial perspective on this most important topic to establish future research agenda encompassing the various dimensions of digital transformation. The purpose of this editorial perspective is to review research on digital transformation from a multidisciplinary viewpoint and provide insights into several key domains—Internet-of-Things, social media, mobile apps, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, the metaverse, and corporate digital responsibility—that are poised to fuel the pace of digital transformation.

The results show that integrating the digital economy and the real economy significantly positively affects green innovation. Improving the integration level of the digital and real economies is conducive to promoting green innovation. Intrinsic mechanisms show significant mediating effects on financing constraints, enterprise digital transformation, and corporate social responsibility. The integration of the digital and real economies can promote enterprise green innovation by alleviating enterprise financing constraints, driving enterprise digital transformation, and promoting corporate social responsibility.

Firms with higher CSR levels motivate their employees to pursue their goals and demonstrate their social responsibility. However, the literature has not adequately examined how firm-level digitalization influences corporate sustainability from a governance perspective. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how digitalization affects CSR disclosure, a key aspect of sustainability, at the firm level. Furthermore, this study also aims to investigate how governance factors, such as management power, internal control and minority shareholder pressure, moderate this effect. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a fixed effect model with robust standard errors to analyze how digitalization and CSR disclosure are related and how this relationship is moderated by governance heterogeneity among Chinese A-share companies from 2010 to 2020. The sample consists of 2,339 firms, of which 360 are SOEs and 1,979 are non-SOEs. To ensure robustness, this study has excluded the observations in 2020 to avoid the effects of COVID-19 and used an alternative measure of CSR disclosure based on the HEXUN CSR disclosure index. Furthermore, this study also explores the link in various corporate-level CSR settings. Findings: The regression findings reveal that: First, Chinese A-share firms with higher digitalization levels disclose less CSR information. This finding holds for both SOEs and non-SOEs. Second, stronger management power has a negative moderating effect that weakens the link between digitalization and CSR disclosure, and this effect is mainly driven by SOEs. Third, internal control attenuates the negative association between firm digitalization and CSR disclosure, which is more pronounced in SOEs. Finally, minority shareholders exacerbate the negative relationship between digitalization and CSR disclosure, and this effect is more evident in non-SOEs. These results are robust to excluding the potential COVID effect and using an alternative HEXUN CSR disclosure index measure. Originality/value: Digitalization and sustainability have been widely discussed at a macro level, but their relationship at a micro level has been largely overlooked. Moreover, there is hardly any evidence on how governance heterogeneity affects this relationship in emerging economies, especially China. This paper addresses these issues by providing empirical evidence on how digital transformation influences CSR disclosure in China, a context where digitalization and CSR are both rapidly evolving. The paper also offers implications for both practitioners and policymakers to design appropriate digital strategies for firm development from diverse business perspectives.","Chinese A-share Firms; Corporate Digitalization; Csr Disclosure; Governance Heterogeneity; Soe And Non-soe Firms","","The authors are very thankful to their colleagues and friends specifically, Huang Chengming and Zhang Chengwei for procuring and analyzing data, and helping to access relevant literature.

The paper summarizes the classic arguments underpinning the “business case” for the social responsibility of businesses and the main moral arguments for responsible and sustainable behavior in light of recent technological ethical challenges. Both streams are confronted with organizational ethical dilemmas arising in designing and deploying artificial intelligence, yielding tensions between social and economic goals. While recognizing the effectiveness of the business argument for responsible behavior in artificial intelligence, the paper addresses some of its main limits, particularly in light of the “digital washing” phenomenon. Exemplary cases of digital washing and corporate inconsistencies here discussed are taken from the literature on the topic and re-assessed in light of the proposed normative approach. Hence, the paper proposes to overcome some limits of the business case for CSR applied to AI, which mainly focuses on compliance and reputational risks and seeks returns in digital washing, by highlighting the normative arguments supporting a moral case for strategic CSR in AI. This work contributes to the literature on business ethics and strategic CSR at its intertwining with the ethics of AI by proposing a normative point of view on how to deploy the moral case in organizations when dealing with AI-related ethical dilemmas. It does so by critically reviewing the state-of-the-art studies on the debate, which, so far, contain different streams of research, and adding to such a body of literature what is here identified and labeled as the “human argument”.","Csr; Csr Washing; Ethical Digital Washing; Ethics Ai; Humanistic Management; Machine Washing; Responsible Ai; Strategic Csr; Artificial Intelligence; Business Development; Compliance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Ethics; Strategic Approach","artificial intelligence; business development; compliance; corporate social responsibility; ethics; strategic approach","","Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence, (2019); Kaplan, Andreas M., Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

Drawing on social network theory, this paper used data from Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2020 as a sample and found that independent directors’ interlocking network position significantly enhanced corporate green innovation. Additionally, digital transformation positively moderated this impact, while environmental regulations exhibited a U-shaped influence on this relationship. Further analysis revealed that independent directors’ interlocking network position can enhance green innovation through leveraging information, resource advantages, and environmental responsibilities. The network position of companies with lower pollution levels and diligent independent directors notably amplified green innovation.

It can affect consumers’ willingness to purchase enterprise products. Corporate social responsibility activities are used by many multinational corporations as a competitive business strategy to build a favorable corporate image in the eyes of consumers. Social media, made possible by developments in web and mobile technology, ushered in a new era of advertising on digital platforms. In this context, it has become an important topic to study the relationship between the authenticity of online CSR communication messages and consumers’ purchase intentions. This work proposes an algorithm based on PSO-1DCNN joint optimization to analyze the impact of online CSR information authenticity on consumers’ purchase intention in social media on the Internet platform. First, this work uses one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) to model the relationship between the two. This model uses multichannel convolution feature, BN and Dropout strategy to promote performance for the model. Secondly, this work designs optimization measures from inertia weight and learning factor to build an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO). Third, this work uses IPSO to optimize the initial network parameters of 1DCNN to build IPSO-1DCNN. The model has stronger convergence ability and convergence speed, in addition, it also has stronger global optimization ability. Fourthly, systematic experiments are carried out for the IPSO-1DCNN designed in this work, and the experimental data verify the superiority of this method.","Consumer Purchase Intention; Impact Analysis; Online Csr Message Authenticity; Pso-1dcnn; Authentication; Convolution; Neural Networks; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Purchasing; Sales; Social Networking (online); Consumer Purchase; Consumer Purchase Intention; Corporate Social Responsibility; Impact Analysis; Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms; Multi-national Corporations; Online Corporate Social Responsibility Message Authenticity; Pso-1dcnn; Purchase Intention; Social Media; Global Optimization","Authentication; Convolution; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Consumer purchase; Consumer purchase intention; Corporate social responsibility; Impact analysis; Improved particle swarm optimization algorithms; Multi-national corporations; Online corporate social responsibility message authenticity; PSO-1DCNN; Purchase intention; Social media; Global optimization","","China Internet Network Information Center 2020 the 49th Statistical Report on Chinas; undefined; Invest Res, (2021); Wto Econ Guide, (2014); undefined, (2022); Li, Jiahua, Evolutionary Game and Simulation on the Internet of Things in Supply Chain, Uncertainty and Operations Research, pp. 271-279, (2017); Sun, Baowen, Research on market power and market structure: A direct measure of market power of internet platform enterprises, International Journal of Crowd Science, 1, 3, pp. 210-222, (2017); Ge, Jianxin, Entrepreneurial resources, complementary assets, and platform sustainability, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 16, (2019); Zhang, Ke, The fluid gels: A research review, E3S Web of Conferences, 213, (2020); Int Core J Eng, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162024658"

Research on the association between the use of walking programs and the number of daily steps taken is limited. Objective: To evaluate the association between use of a smartphone-based shopping mall walking program and daily steps taken after the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study evaluated a nationwide longitudinal data set of 217344 registered smartphone app users at least 18 years of age residing in Japan. Daily step counts were collected from January 1 to December 31, 2021. Exposures: The mall walking program Mall Challenge integrated a global positioning system with a smartphone app's incentive system to reward achieving a goal of 1000 daily steps with lottery-based coupons to win from 0 to 500 shopping points (1 point equaled 1 yen or approximately US $0.01). Main Outcomes and Measures: Daily step records were collected from the smartphone app's walking program and adjusted for gender and age. Multilevel analyses using mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate the coefficients for the association between daily participation in the walking program and daily step counts. Cross-level interaction terms of age and gender by walking program participation were included in one model. Results: Among the 217344 registered mall app users (23638110 daily step records; 154616 [71.1%] women; 18014 [8.3%] participants 65 years or older, and 199330 [91.7%] adults younger than 65 years), the mean (SD) daily steps were 7415 (4686) on walking program participation days and 5281 (4339) on days without participation in the program. Walking program participation days were associated with 1219 additional daily steps (95% CI, 1205-1232) compared with nonparticipation days after adjusting for gender and age. By geographic region, participation in the walking program was associated with 1130 (95% CI, 1113-1146) more steps in rural malls, 1403 (95% CI, 1379-1428) more steps in suburban malls, and 1433 (95% CI, 1408-1457) more steps in urban malls than nonparticipation. Moreover, participation in the walking program was associated with 1422 (95% CI, 1405-1439) more steps in large malls and 1059 (95% CI, 1041-1077) more steps in small malls compared with nonparticipation. Regarding cross-level interactions, women were associated with walking 728 (95% CI, 698-758) more steps than men, and older adults were associated with walking 228 (95% CI, 183-273) more steps than younger adults on walking program participation days. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that the use of a smartphone-based mall walking program combined with physical shopping mall facilities and lottery-based digital incentive coupons may motivate people to increase their daily number of walking steps.","Adult; Age; Article; Cohort Analysis; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Corporate Social Responsibility; Female; Geography; Human; Incentive; Japan; Linear Regression Analysis; Lockdown; Longitudinal Study; Major Clinical Study; Male; Pandemic; Participation; Physical Activity; Reward; Search Engine; Sex Difference; Shopping Mall; Step Count; Walking; Aged; Aged; Cohort Studies; Covid-19; Female; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Pandemics; Smartphone","adult; age; Article; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; corporate social responsibility; female; geography; human; incentive; Japan; linear regression analysis; lockdown; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; pandemic; participation; physical activity; reward; search engine; sex difference; shopping mall; step count; walking; aged; Aged; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Pandemics; Smartphone","This work was supported by grants KAKENHI 19K04785, 20H00557, 22K04450, 22K21138, and 23K16349 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Open Innovation Platform with Enterprises, Research Institute, and Academia (OPERA, JPMJOP183) from Japan Science and Technology; and from AEON MALL Co Ltd","Bull, Fiona C., World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 54, 24, pp. 1451-1462, (2020); Piercy, Katrina L., The physical activity guidelines for Americans, JAMA, 320, 19, pp. 2020-2028, (2018); Kyu, Hmwe Hmwe, Physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke events: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, BMJ, 354, (2016); Lear, Scott A., The effect of physical activity on mortality and cardiovascular disease in 130 000 people from 17 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries: the PURE study, The Lancet, 390, 10113, pp. 2643-2654, (2017); Warburton, Darren E.R., Health benefits of physical activity: A systematic review of current systematic reviews, Current Opinion in Cardiology, 32, 5, pp. 541-556, (2017); Lee, I.

This paper introduces the concept of responsible users, defined as users who make decisions considering their CSR preferences in platform settings. However, how responsible users may affect platform strategic behavior and competition is unclear. Therefore, we propose a computational model of platform price competition that considers the presence of responsible users. We find that CSR preferences have pro-competitive effects that reduce prices and profits in equilibrium. However, this effect depends on how large CSR preferences can be. We also explore several market asymmetries and clarify their implication for platform price structures and profits. Furthermore, we find that it only matters that users express their CSR preferences, regardless of how those preferences are generated. By integrating the responsible user concept into platform competition, our work contributes to both platform competition and CSR literature. We discuss practical implications for platform users and managers and future research opportunities.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Platform Competition; Responsible Platform; Responsible User","","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on 172 digital supply chain announcements disclosing CSR information from Chinese A-share listed companies, this study uses event study method to test the hypotheses. Findings: First, digital supply chain announcements disclosing CSR information generate positive and significant market reactions, which is timely. Second, strategic CSR and value-based CSR disclosed in digital supply chain announcements have a more positive impact on stock market, however there is no significant difference when the CSR orientation is either towards internal or external stakeholders. Third, in terms of digital supply chain network characteristics, announcements reflecting higher relationship embeddedness and higher digital breadth and depth lead to more positive increases of stock value. Originality/value: First, the authors consider the value of CSR information in digital supply chain announcements, using an event study approach to fill the gap in the related area. This study is the first examination of the joint impact of digital supply chain and CSR on market reactions.

This paper explains the concept of corporate digital responsibility (CDR) and how it is affected by new advances in AI. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build on the work of Wirtz et al., (2023) and derive several managerial implications for the challenges that AI poses to CDR. CDR refers to a service company's ethical and fair use of data and technology within its digital service ecosystem. It involves establishing standards, protecting customer privacy, conducting external audits and striving for an equitable power dynamic between service firms and their partners. Findings: Despite the risks involved, many companies are not prioritizing good CDR practices. Financial benefits from the collection and use of consumer data, improved customer experience through AI-driven customization and personalization, cost reduction through service automation and the trade-offs between organizational goals and CDR practices can prevent companies from prioritizing good CDR practices. Originality/value: This is one of the first articles in the service domain to take the concept of CDR and apply it to recent developments in generative AI. Research limitations/implications: The emergence of powerful AI tools presents opportunities and challenges. Research opportunities include responsible business restructuring, responsible service automation to ensure fairness and human oversight, addressing dehumanization of service delivery, responsible customer profiling to address privacy and discrimination concerns and preventing AI misuse.","Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Responsibility; Data Security; Digital Responsibility; Digitalisations; Ethics; Service Technology","","","Belk, Russell V., Ethical issues in service robotics and artificial intelligence, Service Industries Journal, 41, 13-14, pp. 860-876, (2021); Breidbach, Christoph F., Accountable algorithms?

The study findings indicate that the digital economy promotes CSR performance among companies and the influence of the digital economy on CSR performance is pronounced for state-owned and large-scale enterprises. After categorising CSR into three levels: financial, human, and social capital, the results demonstrate that the digital economy continues to facilitate CSR fulfilment across all levels, with the most significant impact observed at the human capital level. Mechanism tests suggest that the digital economy improves CSR fulfilment by alleviating financial constraints, facilitating digital transformation, and enhancing the transparency of internal control information within enterprises.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Economy; Enterprise Digital Transformation","","The fund number of this manuscript is Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences (20BJY102).","Bu, Di, Cultivating Self-Control in FinTech: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Online Consumer Borrowing, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 57, 6, pp. 2208-2250, (2022); Agus Harjoto, Maretno Agus, Corporate Governance and CSR Nexus, Journal of Business Ethics, 100, 1, pp. 45-67, (2011); Chang, Chinghsun, Proactive and reactive corporate social responsibility: Antecedent and consequence, Management Decision, 53, 2, pp. 451-468, (2015); Martin, Patrick R., Managers' green investment disclosures and investors' reaction, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 61, 1, pp. 239-254, (2016); Fatemi, Ali M., Valuation effects of corporate social responsibility, Journal of Banking and Finance, 59, pp. 182-192, (2015); Cennamo, Carmelo, Socioemotional Wealth and Proactive Stakeholder Engagement: Why Family-Controlled Firms Care More About Their Stakeholders, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 36, 6, pp. 1153-1173, (2012); Liu, Tiansen, Bridging production factors allocation and environmental performance of China's heavy-polluting energy firms: The moderation effect of financing and internationalization, Energy, 222, (2021); Barbera, Anthony J., The impact of environmental regulations on industry productivity: Direct and indirect effects, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 18, 1, pp. 50-65, (1990); Nikolaou, I.

Design/methodology/approach: Data collection was conducted through a survey completed by 311 owners and top managers operating in service, trading and manufacturing sector SMEs positioned within the twin cities of Pakistan. A convenient purposively sampling technique and snowball method were used for data collection, and structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Findings: The results of this study suggest that CSR digitalization has a markedly positive influence on the SCP. Digital organizational culture appears to moderate these relationships. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of considering CSR digitalization and fostering a digital organizational culture for SMEs to achieve SCP. The findings provide valuable insights for strategic decision-makers, including owners, CEOs and senior management of SMEs, to enhance their knowledge concerning how and why a digital organizational culture makes it easier to digitalize CSR activities, with the ultimate objective of ensuring SCP and SME growth. Overall, the findings of this study have practical implications for policymakers and managers in SMEs as they can promote the adoption of digital technologies in CSR initiatives and develop a digital organizational culture within the organization. This would contribute to enhancing the SCP of SMEs. Thus, this research is beneficial for business actors, policymakers and researchers seeking to enhance SMEs’ SCP. Social implications: This study provides valuable guidance to the senior management of SMEs regarding successfully adopting and integrating digital technologies into their CSR practices. This integration can lead to increased social and environmental benefits, which positively impact both business and society. Policymakers can use these findings to develop policies and initiatives to encourage CSR digitalization among SMEs. By providing support and incentives for digital transformation, policymakers can help SMEs adopt digital tools to improve their CSR performance, contributing to economic growth and sustainability. Originality/value: This study pioneers research on the links between CSR digitalization, digital organizational culture and the SCP of SMEs. This study contributes to the literature by defining CSR digitalization as an antecedent to the SCP of SMEs. In addition, this study underlines the significance of CSR digitalization for the achievement of SMEs’ SCP of SMEs with the moderating role of digital organizational culture.

There are many economic and technological advantages of digitalization. Along with economic benefits, manufacturing enterprises especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need to take advantage of digitalization in strengthening their social performance. Observing the importance of social performance of Indian SMEs and availability of limited research in this direction, the current study has done a holistic analysis of social performance enablers. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review with a series of personal interviews of experts has been conducted to identify the enablers of social performance and supportive digital technologies. A fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach has been applied to find the degree of influence and interrelation between enablers. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to validate the results obtained. Findings: Authors observed that policies of corporate and social responsibility, support by top management, awareness of social performance issues, and ethical practices and collaboration amongst supply chain members are leading causing enablers of social performance. Preparedness for the uncertainty of pandemics, improved work conditions and ergonomics, green practices, improvement in global business and improved living standards of employees and their families are leading the effect group of enablers. Further authors also observed that social media, information and communication technologies (ICT), websites, smart surveillance, e-mails and cloud computing are few supportive digital technologies of social performance issues. Research limitations/implications: SMEs all over the globe are passing through a transition due to digitalization and influence of pandemics. The finding of current study highlights the importance of strategic management of social performance enablers. Since the research is very limited in the social performance area, especially in Indian SMEs, this study makes a notable contribution to the literature too.

Based on the literature research method, this paper aims to elucidate the mechanism of digital transformation's impact on corporate ESG performance by interpreting the core of the existing literature, and to explore whether and how digital transformation promotes corporate ESG performance. This study suggests that digital transformation significantly enhances firms' ESG performance by reducing costs, improving internal information transparency, and enhancing technological innovation. Additionally, factors such as industry attributes, property rights attributes, media attention, and management characteristics moderate the direction and extent of the impact. From the perspective of Digital transformation, this paper provides systematic ideas and methods to enhance corporate ESG performance, offering insights for achieving low-carbon targets and economic objectives.","Digital Transformation; Esg Performance; Impact Mechanisms; Research Outlook; Corporates; Digital Transformation; Economic Benefits; Esg Performance; Impact Mechanism; Operational Efficiencies; Perceived Capabilities; Performance; Research Outlook; Research Review","Corporates; Digital transformation; Economic benefits; ESG performance; Impact mechanism; Operational efficiencies; Perceived capabilities; Performance; Research outlook; Research review","","Tian, Lichuan, Does digital economy affect corporate ESG performance?

SCM has both designed and monitored numerous tasks with the following phases such as allocation, creation, product sourcing, and warehousing. Based on this perspective, the privacy of data flow is more important among producers, suppliers, and customers to ensure the responsibility of the market. This work aims to develop a novel Improved Digital Navigator Assessment (DNA)-based Self Improved Pelican Optimization Algorithm (IDNA-based SIPOA model) for secured data transmission in SCM via blockchain. An improved DNA cryptosystem is done for the process of preservation for data. The original message is encrypted by Improved Advanced Encryption Standard (IAES).

However, inadequate regulatory frameworks in Malaysia have led to various human rights concerns, particularly regarding the protection of workers' rights, such as social security, fair remuneration and safe working conditions. Furthermore, the challenge of providing worker protections must be balanced with the flexible nature of the gig economy. Thus, this study explored the evolving legal landscape surrounding the protection of platform workers’ rights in Malaysia from both legal and human rights perspectives. It examines the role of business and human rights in finding the delicate balance between economic progress and protecting workers’ fundamental rights, emphasizing the role of regulation. This study adopts a qualitative approach through review of existing literature, including academic research, reports, and relevant legal documents, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. Therefore, this study underscores the urgent need for robust legal frameworks and regulatory measures to safeguard the rights and welfare of platform workers in Malaysia through the integration of corporate responsibility to respect human rights and to establish mechanisms that guarantee fair remuneration, job security, social protection, and avenues for workers’ representation and collective bargaining. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the growing body of literature on platform work and serve as a basis for policy recommendations and advocacy efforts to improve the rights and working conditions of platform workers in Malaysia.","Business And Human Rights; Platform Workers; Workers’ Rights","","","Business and Human Rights in Malaysia Towards Responsible and Ethical Business Development, (2022); Baumann-Pauly, Dorothée, Business and human rights, pp. 1-329, (2016); Digital Labour Platforms and the Future of Work Towards Decent Work in the Online World, (2018); Income Security in the on Demand Economy Findings and Policy Lessons from A Survey of Crowdworkers, (2016); Conen, Wieteke S., Self-employment: Between freedom and insecurity, pp. 1-21, (2019); Human Rights Between Needs and Possibilities, (2017); Comparative Labor Law Policy Journal, (2016); Platform Work and the Employment Relationship, (2021); Rodino-Colocino, Michelle, The GIG Economy: Workers and media in the age of convergence, pp. 3-15, (2021); Self Employed or Not Self Employed Working Conditions of Economically Dependent Workers, (2013)","","Padjadjaran University","24601543; 24429325","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217715126"

Developed through design research methodology, the CDR MM comprises five dimensions and 18 focus areas. The model is the first of its kind in the context of CDR, addressing both the social and environmental aspects of digitalization. Our study diversifies the geographical scope by conducting research within the French context, contributing to the global understanding of CDR. For decision-makers, the CDR MM serves as an evaluative tool, of-fering insights into problematic areas and guiding organizational efforts to align digitalization with sustainable development. The proposed model also lays the groundwork for future research in the field, potentially leading to the development of prescriptive maturity models.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Maturity Model; Sustainable Digitalization; Virtual Corporation; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporates; Decision Makers; Design Research Methodologies; Environmental Aspects; Focus Areas; Maturity Model; Modeling Approach; Social And Environmental; Sustainable Digitalization; Sustainable Development Goals","Virtual corporation; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporates; Decision makers; Design research methodologies; Environmental aspects; Focus areas; Maturity model; Modeling approach; Social and environmental; Sustainable digitalization; Sustainable development goals","","Ghobakhloo, Morteza, Industry 4.0, digitization, and opportunities for sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, 252, (2020); Miceli, Antonio, Thriving, not just surviving in changing times: How sustainability, agility and digitalization intertwine with organizational resilience, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-17, (2021); Sachs, Jeffrey David, Six Transformations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Nature Sustainability, 2, 9, pp. 805-814, (2019); Coroamǎ, Vlad C., Digital rebound – Why digitalization will not redeem us our environmental sins, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2382, (2019); Digital Reset Redirecting Technologies for the Deep Sustainability Transformation, (2025); Sustainability Management Forum, (2021); Folke, Carl S., Resilience: The emergence of a perspective for social-ecological systems analyses, Global Environmental Change, 16, 3, pp. 253-267, (2006); Zimmer, Markus Philipp, Responsibility of/in digital transformation, Journal of Responsible Technology, 16, (2023); Alojail, Mohammed Ali, Impact of Digital Transformation toward Sustainable Development, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 20, (2023); Ortiz-de-Mandojana, Natalia, The long-term benefits of organizational resilience through sustainable business practices, Strategic Management Journal, 37, 8, pp. 1615-1631, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798331505288","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216089945"

Corporate goal is to minimize emissions from Gas lift (GL) wells, ensuring environmental responsibility while maintaining production efficiency. To achieve production targets while preventing unnecessary flaring, high (Gas Oil Ratio) GOR wells are closed or partially choked by Operation engineers manually but being vigilant hasn't proven to give optimum results. This paper details the successful implementation of autonomous flare control at a single station utilizing a well management system (WMS). Following the effective execution of the Flare Limit Control project within the WMS, a comprehensive change management strategy was deployed. Operations engineers were empowered to configure, update, and remove wells from the automated flare control scope within the WMS. Autonomous well control was achieved through continuous flare monitoring in the WMS. High Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) wells were closed when the flare limit was exceeded, and the last closed wells were automatically reopened once the flare was reduced. Through meticulous analysis, significant improvements were noted in reducing hydrocarbon emissions, saving on deferment and huge time saving following the project's implementation. The total yearly benefit is estimated to be around 185,000 USD from increased wells' uptime and time saving from one station. An additional 0.08% cost saving is estimated from additional CAPEX to reduce CO<inf>2</inf> emissions as per PDO corporate target. Following improvements have contributed to value estimation from automated flare control: • 8% more uptime from wells which are part of flare control logic. • 4% engineers' time saving • 33% of flare reduction The Flare control HMI (Human Machine Interface) screen offers Operation engineers a user-friendly interface, equipped with essential and informative details. The interface empowers them to effectively control flare automatically, ensuring not only minimal emissions but also reducing deferment and time saving. The implementation of new technologies has supported in overcoming operational challenges and efficiently managing the flare. An autonomous and intelligent logic has been introduced for controlling flare in real-time taking a bold step in digital transformation journey of PDO.","Decision Making; Gas Oils; Gasoline; Intelligent Well Technology; 'current; Corporates; Gas Oil Ratios; Gas-lift Wells; Hydrocarbon Emission; Management Systems; Oil And Gas Operations; Petroleum Development Oman; Sustainable Practices; Well Management; Gas Lifts","Decision making; Gas oils; Gasoline; Intelligent well technology; 'current; Corporates; Gas oil ratios; Gas-lift wells; Hydrocarbon emission; Management systems; Oil and gas operations; Petroleum development Oman; Sustainable practices; Well management; Gas lifts","The authors acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEM), and the management of Petroleum Development Oman for providing the environment to do this work and granting permission for this paper to be published.

Our findings reveal a U-shaped relationship between CSR and bank performance, with initial negative effects followed by positive impacts beyond a certain threshold. Digitalization investments show similar patterns, with short-term costs but long-term benefits when integrated with CSR initiatives. The study finds that large, state-owned, and listed banks benefit differently from CSR and digitalization investments. Additionally, bank characteristics such as size, credit risk, and ownership structure significantly moderate these relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on these relationships is also examined.

Integrating real-time data, simulation models, and machine learning (ML), the system manages automatic data acquisition, dynamic model updates, and real-time management. Interactive dashboards enable users to monitor operations, ensure flow assurance, predict future dynamics, and provide diagnostic and safety functions. The digital twin sets a new standard for intelligent and safe UGS operations and helps operators to achieve decarbonization. The UGS digital twin seamlessly integrates geoengineering, ML-assisted diagnostics, and online workflows across petroleum engineering and geomechanics domains. High-frequency data from digital oilfield instrumentation and user inputs via dashboards feed into structured query language (SQL) and open platform communications (OPC) based databases. Automated workflows use these data and multidisciplinary models for UGS management. Key features include: 1. On-demand reservoir geomechanical coupled simulation, to predict geomechanical risks for production and injection cycles respectively and advise the maximum drawdown and injection pressures. 2. Daily reservoir-to-surface network simulation, for operational planning and scheduling to proactively respond to changes in operational requirements. 3. Daily wellbore and network simulation, to identify flow assurance issues, e.g. sanding, liquid holdup, erosion, and hydrate formation, and evaluate pipeline transportation efficiency to monitor system status, and identify operational risks. 4. Real-time flow twin simulation, to analyze pipelines for liquid inventory, pigging, and gas leak detection and ensure the system operates at lower risk and in a safer mode. 5. Real-time ML-assisted detection, to diagnose choke malfunctioning and wellhead hydrates for maintaining optimal efficiency and safety. This groundbreaking solution sets a new benchmark for UGS in China by integrating multidisciplinary insights into a single collaborative platform. The digital twin automates field development strategies, shifting from experience-based to model-based approaches. Predictive techniques for pipeline hydrate formation help operators anticipate and mitigate issues, reducing operational risks, dehydration costs, and downtime. Consequently, stakeholders can respond quickly to market demands, thereby enhancing overall organizational effectiveness. Valued at approximately 2.5 million USD, this project supports 50% of peak natural gas consumption in cities like Beijing and has inspired three similar ventures in the region. It aims to potentially reduce CO2 emissions by 5 million tons annually, ensuring safer, more efficient, and optimized UGS operations. The UGS digital twin leverages advanced technology, including geoengineering and ML, to revolutionize daily UGS operations.

However, scholars have mainly used unidimensional scales to measure trust. Drawing upon the Trust Transfer Model, this study assessed how different dimensions of digital platform trust, dual-role users (acting as both host and guest), and corporate social responsibility (CSR) influence trust in Peer-to-Peer hosts. A survey with 894 Airbnb users tested the study’s hypotheses. The findings show that platform competence-based trust and CSR strongly influence trust toward hosts, while integrity has a weaker effect, and benevolence is only significant for dual-role users. Host trust mediates the relationship between platform trusting beliefs and customer satisfaction. The study reveals that dual-role users moderate the relationship between benevolence-based trust and trust toward hosts, while CSR’s effect on host trust is stronger for users with single role. The study has implications for Peer-to-Peer organizations and service providers.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Dual And Single-role Users; Multidimensional Trust; Online Trust; Peer-to-peer Accommodation Sharing; Sharing Economy","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the French Franchising Federation (FFF).","Abrate, Graziano, Personal or Product Reputation?

However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.","Data-driven Operations; Digital Transformation; Information Extraction (ie); Large Language Models (llms); Multi-agent Rag; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Decentralized Finance; Data Driven; Data-driven Operation; Decisions Makings; Digital Transformation; Information Extraction; Language Model; Large Language Model; Multi Agent; Multi-agent Retrieval-augmented Generation; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Development Goals","Decentralized finance; Data driven; Data-driven operation; Decisions makings; Digital transformation; Information extraction; Language model; Large language model; Multi agent; Multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable development goals","The authors thank the French government for the funding.","Szopik-Depczyńska, Katarzyna, User-driven innovation in Poland: Determinants and recommendations, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Hinnüber, Felix, The Effects of a First-Time Experience on the Evaluation of Battery Electric Vehicles by Potential Consumers, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2019); Shafi, Mohsin, INNOVATION IN TRADITIONAL HANDICRAFT COMPANIES TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

Motivation CSR has garnered substantial attention in contemporary society. Simultaneously, the last few decades have witnessed a rapid surge of the digital economy. However, it remains unclear how CSR is adapting to digitalization. In this study, I focused on cybersecurity, a pivotal challenge in the digital age. Theoretical reasoning The enactment of data breach disclosure laws enhances the reporting of cybersecurity incidents and intensifies concerns about cybersecurity, promoting firms to take measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of data breaches. Building on the theory that CSR functions like an insurance policy, I hypothesized that firms increase their engagement in CSR to fortify their reputation after the enactment of data breach disclosure laws, helping cushion the potential impact of future breaches. Analyses The main analysis employed a difference-in-differences research design to compare the changes in CSR engagement between firms with high and low levels of cybersecurity risk following the enactment of data breach disclosure laws in the United States. Cross-sectional analyses delved into the underlying mechanisms. Additional analyses first explored the role of CSR in mitigating stock price decline and then illustrated reputational concerns after data breaches. Findings The main analysis showed that firms with high cybersecurity risk increase their CSR engagement to a greater extent following the adoption of data breach disclosure laws. CSR initiatives are particularly pronounced for firms likely to incur significant losses from data breaches, aligning with the theoretical framework and offering insight into the underlying mechanisms. I also found that firms with fewer financial constraints exhibit stronger CSR initiatives. Furthermore, these CSR initiatives are distinct and cannot be substituted by investments in information technology. The additional analysis illustrates that firms with superior CSR performance undergo a smaller stock price decline surrounding data breach announcements. This supports the notion that CSR functions much like insurance, shielding against the impacts of data breaches. Subsequently, this study presents direct evidence on firms' concerns regarding the reputational impact of cybersecurity. Overall, this study underscores cybersecurity concerns as a driving force behind social responsibility initiatives in this digital era. Target population This research holds significance for policymakers worldwide who are considering cybersecurity-related regulations and for firms seeking effective risk management strategies in the face of cybersecurity challenges.","Csr; Cybersecurity; Data Breaches; Digitalization; Esg","","","Hacking Corporate Reputations, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: Theory and empirical evidence, Management Science, 65, 10, pp. 4451-4469, (2019); Amir, Eli, Do firms underreport information on cyber-attacks?

In this article the authors contend that this emanates from an implicit neoliberal governance agenda promoting deepening career uncertainty amidst transformative digital innovation and radical corporate restructuring. Among the effects of such changes have been managers experiencing longer working hours, greater work intensification and worsening work–life balance. The authors argue such effects have been particularly acute for women and notably under the institutional (economic, political and social) constraints of the coronavirus pandemic. Presenting quasi-longitudinal information from three qualitative studies (based on data collected variously in Japan, the UK and USA in 2002–2006, 2015–2019 and 2020–2021) the article considers not only women managers’ experiences of work since the millennium, but also their occupational prospects for the future. The authors conclude that under neoliberalism the enduring interaction of organizational restructuring, precarious employment and work intensification will continue to affect adversely the equilibrium between women managers’ personal lives and their professional work, given many confront increasing demands of corporate availability and work-related connectivity whilst simultaneously dealing with significant parenting and care responsibilities.","Coronavirus; Corporate Restructuring; Digital Innovation; Neoliberalism; Precarious Work; Women Managers","","","Acker, Joan, Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations, Gender and Society, 4, 2, pp. 139-158, (1990); Acker, Joan, Inequality regimes: Gender, class, and race in organizations, Gender and Society, 20, 4, pp. 441-464, (2006); Acker, Joan, The gender regime of Swedish banks, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 22, 3, pp. 195-209, (2006); Adamson, Maria, Postfeminism, Neoliberalism and A ‘Successfully’ Balanced Femininity in Celebrity CEO Autobiographies, Gender, Work and Organization, 24, 3, pp. 314-327, (2017); Ahl, Helene Jonson, Exploring the false promise of entrepreneurship through a postfeminist critique of the enterprise policy discourse in Sweden and the UK, Human Relations, 74, 1, pp. 41-68, (2021); Alberti, Gabriella, In, Against and Beyond Precarity: Work in Insecure Times, Work, Employment and Society, 32, 3, pp. 447-457, (2018); International Journal of Labour Research, (2021); Handbook of Families and Work Interdisciplinary Perspectives, (2009); Impact of Covid 19 on Gender Equality, (2020); Stupidity Paradox the Power and Pitfalls of Functional Stupidity at Work, (2016)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","0143831X; 14617099","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211941005"

This research paper investigates the role of digital marketing in promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) campaigns, building brand reputation, and fostering meaningful engagement with stakeholders. The study adopts a mixed-method approach, incorporating qualitative and quantitative analysis and primary data gathered from surveys and interviews with marketing professionals and CSR experts. The research analyzes how companies across diverse sectors leverage digital marketing tools and social media platforms to advance their CSR efforts while simultaneously reinforcing their brand reputation. Firstly, the paper explores the use of digital marketing strategies to amplify the reach and impact of CSR initiatives. It delves into how companies maximizing engagement and encouraging positive actions towards social causes. Secondly, the research highlights the role of social media as a powerful channel for fostering brand-consumer relationships and dialogue. Companies are increasingly employing social media platforms to encourage user-generated content, by doing so, organizations are better able to build trust, authenticity, and transparency in their CSR communication. The findings indicate that the strategic integration of digital marketing into CSR campaigns enables companies to reach a broader audience, establish stronger brand reputations, and foster deeper connections with stakeholders.

There are many approaches in our contemporary society that either use IT or the conventional technique. Methods for measuring efficiency fall into three primary categories: parametric, nonparametric, and ratio indicators. We prioritize a firm's inputs and outputs when choosing metrics to measure efficiency. Establishing objectives and goals in entrepreneurship necessitates a thorough comprehension, appreciation, and knowledge of sustainability, and assessing the economic growth quality of a corporation is an essential task for theoretical and empirical sustainability assessment. When measuring the efficiency of entrepreneurship in terms of achieving desired values of macroeconomic indicators (e.g., sustainable economic growth objectives), data envelopment analysis (DEA), a widely used technique in efficiency analysis, has taken into account the economic, environmental, and social impact of entrepreneurship as the three dimensions of sustainability. The objective of this paper is to test the influence of FinTech/Blockchain adoption on corporate ESG and DEI performances using a novel DEA approach for sustainable development assessment. It highlights the significance of using a scalable technique for ESG efficiency study and gives scholars a more thorough viewpoint on the subject. In a collection of 50 enterprises, a DEA model was utilized for the analysis. For sustainable performance assessment using the proposed DEA technique, we defined as inputs six financial metrics, and as outputs 11 ESG/Blockchain adoption, and four DEI quality metrics to measure the firm’s efficiency. The annual business data was gathered between 2017 and 2023. In all country situations we discovered that, when DEI initiatives mediate, there is a strong correlation between ESG corporate performance and the quality of economic growth (particularly in the innovation and integrity blockchain adoption performance success metrics). Our study provides additional in-depth details on the FinTech/blockchain adoption environment in comparison to the findings of previous researchers. The sustainable entrepreneurship performance (a latent variable regarded as a dependent target factor) is calculated using eight (8) factors as observed variables, which is the first to consider the dynamics of ESG/BCA and DEI quality metrics as DEA outputs. The study also examines the mediating role of DEI corporate initiatives. By conducting an empirical investigation, the suggested scalable framework makes it evident which company is more efficient in moving toward sustainability, assisting corporate management in increasing the effectiveness of economic growth.","Blockchain; Dei; Digital Transformation; Economic Growth; Esg; Fintech; Monitoring Company’s Efficiency","","","Aida, Neli, The Effect of the Tourism Sector on Economic Growth in Indonesia, WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 21, pp. 1158-1166, (2024); Mavrommati, Athanasia, An Empirical Study on Tourism and Economic Growth in Greece: An Autoregressive Distributed Lag Boundary Test Approach, WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 21, pp. 588-602, (2024); Nazarko, Blerta, Performance Evaluation in Macroeconomics based on DEA Malmquist Index with a New Approach for the Efficiency Evaluation in a Two-Stage Process, WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications, 21, pp. 169-185, (2024); Zhou, Haibo, Data envelopment analysis application in sustainability: The origins, development and future directions, European Journal of Operational Research, 264, 1, pp. 1-16, (2018); Strategic Management International Journal of Strategic Management Novi Sad University, (2024); Gulaliyev, Mayis G., Assessing the Impact of the Oil Price Shocks on Economic Growth in Oil-Exporting Arab Countries, WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 19, pp. 462-473, (2022); Hasanagas, Nikolaos D., Environmental policy and science management: Using a scientometric-specific GIS for E-learning purposes, International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 5, 2, pp. 171-178, (2010); Hasanagas, Nikolaos D., E-Learning & environmental policy: The case of a politico-administrative GIS, International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 5, 4, pp. 517-524, (2010); Mebratu, Desta, Sustainability and sustainable development: Historical and conceptual review, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 18, 6, pp. 493-520, (1998); Škare, Marinko, Measuring economic growth using data envelopment analysis, Amfiteatru Economic, 18, 42, pp. 386-406, (2016)","","World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society","11099526; 22242899","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209872606"

An online cross-sectional survey was used to collect data from 126 agricultural, manufacturing, and service firms. The study used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the hypothesized relationship. Our findings reveal that the impact of CDR on financial performance is indirect only as firm reputation plays a full, complementary mediation role in the CDR—financial performance nexus. This implies that firms could leverage CDR as a competitive “inducing” strategy to enhance their firm reputation, which, in turn, can boost their financial prospects. Our study significantly contributes to the business ethics and digital economy literature by offering a pioneering empirical validation of the CDR phenomenon in an emerging context, thus extending the signaling and stakeholder theories to digitalization and reputation management domains. The findings offer managers fresh insight into the potential impact of a CDR strategy on firm reputation and financial performance, showing that firms can leverage CDR as a loss prevention strategy to gain a competitive advantage. Policymakers are therefore urged to promote soft-law regimes and policies on CDR to motivate companies to leverage it as a competitive tool.","Corporate Reputation; Financial Performance; Orporate Digital Responsibility; Sem-pls","","","Abbate, Stefano, The digital and sustainable transition of the agri-food sector, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 187, (2023); Abbate, Tindara, Blockchain and art market: resistance or adoption?, Consumption Markets and Culture, 25, 2, pp. 105-123, (2022); Challenge of Corporate Digital Responsibility an Analysis of Key Elements for CDR Implementation, (2023); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); MIS Quarterly, (2021); Social Protection in Ethiopia Making the Case for A More Comprehensive and Equitable Intervention in the Digital Economy, (2020); Bonsón, Enrique, Disclosures about algorithmic decision making in the corporate reports of Western European companies, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 48, (2023); Brynjolfsson, Erik, The rapid adoption of data-driven decision-making, American Economic Review, 106, 5, pp. 133-139, (2016); Caputo, Francesco, Digital platforms and international performance of Italian SMEs: an exploitation-based overview, International Marketing Review, 39, 3, pp. 568-585, (2022); Cardinali, Pier Giacomo, Responsible digitalization through digital technologies and green practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 4, pp. 984-995, (2022)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","26946416; 26946424","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209776276"

Design/methodology/approach: This study identifies 446 focal companies in the European Economic Area that introduced new CWSs during 2017–2021. Then, the peers are defined as companies with existing CWS practices that are similar in size to each focal company. Using a quantitative approach, this study uses a logistic regression model. Findings: This study finds that companies are more likely to adopt digital CWS if their country peers (not, industry peers) have done so, especially the ones operated in countries where governments build CSR partnerships with companies through cooperative consensus. However, the role of country peers is less prominent when companies have CSR committees. Practical implications: This study shows the importance of country norms over competitive pressure in CSR. Nevertheless, the results offer additional insights for policy-makers by showing that country regulations mandating CWSs are not significant in promoting the adoption of digital CWS nor reducing the role of country peers. Social implications: Providing CWSs with digital platforms may show corporate commitment to better preventing social misconduct and improving social responsibility. Originality/value: While most literature focuses on the role of industry peers and/or community peers in a single-country setting, this study examines the role of country peers specifically on digitalization regarding CSR and governance.","Corporate Whistleblowing System; Digitalization; Isomorphism; Peer Effects","","","Ahmad, Maqsood, Does CSR digitalization improve the sustainable competitive performance of SMEs?

While CSR has traditionally been analyzed in developed markets, this paper explores how multinational subsidiaries can leverage CSR practices to create financial opportunities and market stability for themselves and their communities in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a panel of data from six listed African companies for the period ranking from January 2006–2022 to analyze the effect of financial performance (FP), digitalization and health measures on the social responsibility of these companies. The authors provide a robust test that improves the understanding of the impact of pandemics and innovation on CSR, using Machine Learning (ML) linear regression. Findings: The results show that the social responsibility of African companies is highly dependent on FP and digitalization. On the other hand, the authors demonstrate that the moderating role of epidemic instability negatively affects social responsibility through FP, but on the other hand strengthens CSR in the presence of digitalization. The results of the initial analysis remain largely unchanged, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the empirical results through ML models. This article highlights some of the obstacles and opportunities for CSR adapted to the crisis context. The authors conclude that adjusting innovation strategies improves the forecasting performance of responsible companies, especially in a context of instability. Research limitations/implications: The paper clearly shows that CSR literature varies across different regions. Given that the financial market in Africa is characterized by a lack of opportunity for innovation as well as financial stability, this paper represents an important first step in the elaboration of a CSR development strategy. In light of the results presented above, the study makes an important contribution to the literature on CSR, in particular the CSR practices of multinationals in developing countries and also provides CSR managers with various insights into the types of support they will need to leverage and improve the internal underpinnings of their CSR strategies and collaboration. Practical implications: The results of this study contribute to the understanding of digital transformation in responsible business, offering empirical evidence of its benefits in tackling the health crisis. In addition, the study highlights the role of an innovative approach in enhancing reputation and developing sustainable, trusting relationships with stakeholders. Originality/value: This research pioneers the academic link between innovation and epidemic crisis in responsible business, filling a notable gap and introducing a new academic perspective. In concrete terms, it provides women entrepreneurs with actionable insights into the digital strategies essential to improving business performance in a context of instability. Methodologically, the study sets a benchmark for research innovation, using ML to provide a reproducible model for exposing robust results and for future research in this evolving field.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Covid-19; Financial Performance; Financial Stability; Gmm; Machine Learning Approach","","","Academy of Management Journal, (1979); Iup Journal of Corporate Governance, (2014); Adomako, Samuel, Politically connected firms and corporate social responsibility implementation expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Ghana, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2701-2711, (2020); Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); International Journal of Scientific Technology Research, (2015); Al-Ali Mubarak, Y.

In this context, a significant evolution in the logic of corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be observed, particularly in the digital sphere. By extending Carroll’s three-dimensional model to include corporate digital responsibility (CDR), this paper addresses a key research question: How does CSR evolve and develop in the dynamic digital industry of esports? Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a qualitative multiple case study research design. It drew on secondary data from 50 professional esports organisations and key players in CSR development in the global esports industry, such as game publishers, pro-teams, pro-athletes, event organisers, and governing bodies. A content analysis of 50 official websites and 72 public annual, CSR, and environmental reports for the financial years ending in 2021 and 2022 was conducted. Findings: Our empirical findings not only map the territory of esports CSR and CDR but also provide practical insights. These insights are later synthesized to develop an esports CSR/CDR framework that extends Carroll’s three-dimensional model. CSR and CDR domains of esports are theoretically grounded (business performance, responsiveness, social issues, and digital responsibilities), while practical implications for managers and academics are forwarded. Originality/value: This paper stands out as a pioneering empirical study, filling a significant research gap in the fields of CSR and CDR in esports. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to illuminate these concepts within the unique ecosystem of esports, thereby contributing to the evolving understanding of CSR in the digital context.","Cdr; Csr; Digital Ethics; Digitalization; Gaming","","","Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Andersen, Nicolai, Redesigning corporate responsibility how digitalization changes the role companies need to play for positive impacts on society, pp. 137-147, (2019); Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby, Corporate social responsibility: The good, the bad and the ugly, Critical Sociology, 34, 1, pp. 51-79, (2008); Brown, R.

Recognizing the challenges of reaching such a vast and diverse population, Burnwal enlisted the expertise of Mr Gitesh Sharma to develop a strategic plan. Sharma’s approach involved leveraging traditional and digital media to maximize visibility, including newspapers, television, radio and internet marketing. He also proposed innovative grassroots initiatives, such as engaging MBA students in internship programmes to lead village educational awareness campaigns. Additionally, Sharma recommended forming partnerships with NGOs to further amplify these efforts in rural areas, where access to educational resources is often limited. Digital marketing was identified as a key tool, focusing on platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn and on mobile-based ads to reach a broader student audience. Sharma also emphasized the importance of meticulously planned digital platforms—such as mobile apps and websites—that offer clear, detailed guidance for scholarship applicants. Burnwal considered whether these strategies would effectively help Buddy4Study reach its ambitious target and impact the educational landscape in India.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Platform; Entrepreneurship","","","Al Amosh, Hamzeh, ESG disclosure and idiosyncratic risk in initial public offerings., Social and Environmental Accountability Journal, 43, 2, pp. 188-189, (2023); Buddy4study, (2022); Buddy4study Celebrates 2nd Annual Scholars Day Inspiring A Nation Wide Scholar Community, (2024); Dropout Rates in Government and Private Schools, (2018); Education and Training Industry in India, (2022); Livemint, (2021); Csr Spend on Education Differently Abled and Livelihood, (2021); News18, (2021); Buddy4study, (2019); Krasia, (2021)","","Sage Publications India Pvt.

We address the gap in understanding the institutionalization of digital compliance as a part of CDR. Design/methodology/approach: Using institutional theory, we assess the impact of coercive, mimetic and normative forces on digital compliance. We used survey data from 162 predominantly large German companies and analyzed it through ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Findings: Mimetic forces, driven by competitor knowledge, substantially affect digital compliance. Normative forces related to professional knowledge are also influential, while coercive forces exerted by customers have no significant impact on the adoption of digital compliance. In a supplemental analysis, the study highlights the moderating role of organizational agility. Research limitations/implications: CDR is not limited to digital compliance. Future research should explore higher levels of CDR and consider stakeholders beyond customers. The focus on large German companies may limit generalizability. Practical implications: The findings stress the importance of understanding competitive landscapes and professional discourses. Managers should be aware of these institutional forces and incorporate them into strategic planning for digital compliance and CDR. Originality/value: This research extends institutional theory to digital compliance, offering insights into CDR-related corporate behavior and strategy, emphasizing the importance of competitor awareness and professional norms to manage digital risks.","Cdr; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Institutional Theory","","","Altman, Douglas G., Statistics notes: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, BMJ, 311, 7003, (1995); Babiak, Kathy M., CSR and environmental responsibility: Motives and pressures to adopt green management practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 18, 1, pp. 11-24, (2011); Barakat, Simone Ruchdi, The influence of corporate social responsibility on employee satisfaction, Management Decision, 54, 9, pp. 2325-2339, (2016); Bergkvist, Lars, The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 2, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bollen, Kenneth Alan, Conventional wisdom on measurement: A structural equation perspective, Psychological Bulletin, 110, 2, pp. 305-314, (1991); Bondy, Krista, An Institution of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Multi-National Corporations (MNCs): Form and Implications, Journal of Business Ethics, 111, 2, pp. 281-299, (2012); Campbell, John L., Why would corporations behave in socially responsible ways?

Many companies responded actively by contributing to government efforts in addressing post-pandemic economic challenges, particularly through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. This research aims to identify opportunities and challenges in digitalizing CSR to mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses on the CSR program, Indosat Digital Camp (IDCamp), implemented by Indosat Ooredoo. The objective is to evaluate the opportunities and challenges faced by Indosat Ooredoo in digitizing CSR to address the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a qualitative methodology and a single case study design, the research involves interviews with 6 representatives from Indosat Ooredoo and 10 IDCamp participants from Yogyakarta, Bandung, Jakarta, Kabupaten Ogan Komering Ulu, and Kota Tangerang. Research findings reveal that digitalizing CSR presents sustainable opportunities as it can reduce unemployment, provide industry-relevant competencies, align with Indonesia's digital era, remain relevant to post-COVID-19 digital activities, align with government programs, support the demand for digital talents, and attract community participation due to its practical nature. However, IDCamp implementation poses potential challenges, including responsive organization, internet network issues, government program support, program updates, established execution systems, coordination with mass media, and ensuring digitalization facilitates community participation in CSR programs.","Covid-19 Pandemic; Csr Challenges; Csr Collaboration; Csr Digitization; Csr Opportunities","","","Abid, Tarek, What corporate social responsibility brings to brand management?

Recent international (OECD and EU) and, to a lesser extent, domestic initiatives have attempted to adapt the structure of corporate taxation to those changes. However, corporate taxes continue to be built on traditional concepts such as legal personality, residence and income which, due to structural weaknesses, may appear to inadequately determine what types of contributions may be required from corporate actors. Therefore, while we acknowledge the merits of recent international initiatives such as Pillars 1 and 2 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, it is of value to explore alternatives such as more targeted taxes based on transactions and value as well as a renewed conception of ‘contribution’ by corporate actors. Three possibilities are analysed: transaction-based taxes, taxes on corporate value, and a re-elaboration of the idea of tax as a contribution (in money or in-kind) inspired by the concept of corporate social responsibility.","Alternative Methods; Corporate Taxation; Digital Economy; Mnes; Oecd; Pillar 1; Pillar 2","","23 This is highlighted, among others, by CORPNET researchers, who are involved in a five-year project initiated in September 2015 and located at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research, University of Amsterdam, which is funded by the European Research Council (\u2018ERC\u2019 starting grant).

This study explores “brand activism,” a phenomenon whereby brands engage in social advocacy through digital platforms, reflecting a strategic integration of social issues into their core identity and marketing practices. This proactive stance not only raises awareness and mobilizes support but also raises ethical concerns about the potential for brands to exploit social causes for commercial gain. Employing qualitative content analysis with a critical phenomenological approach, this research investigates how individuals engage empathy-based representations within brand activism on digital platforms. Data from interviews with 37 young adults reveal that while brand activism can foster a sense of empowerment and moral alignment, it also risks superficial engagement and selective empathy.

Due to the need for fast responses to market changes and an ongoing search for a sustainable future, the constraints of information flow among stakeholders become very critical. A global powerhouse company - workshop is facing this issue, which causes activity delays that are considered non-value-adding operations and results in additional costs. Digital technology has been acknowledged for eliminating non-value-adding operations. Digitalization generally requires huge capital investment. However, there is an opportunity to start digital transformation by utilizing existing platforms and applications. This study aims to develop a new framework to assist the company in digital transformation in a cost-effective manner. The proposed framework consists of six modules: identifying the technologies to adapt, categorizing the operations, assessing potential risks, measuring environmental impacts, identifying the advantages, and implementing change management procedures, profitability assessment, and corporate social responsibility programs. The proposed framework was then applied in a global powerhouse company - workshop based on a case study. The results show a significant reduction in time due to the elimination of non-value-added activity (delay). Another tangible benefit is the reduction or even elimination of consumption of bond papers by up to 98% or 100%, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and minimizing environmental impact. Further savings of 100% are contributed by the elimination of paper storage and the reduction of service fees for printers.","Digitalization; Lean Production System; Non-value-added Operations","","","Arey, Daniel, Lean industry 4.0: A digital value stream approach to process improvement, Procedia Manufacturing, 54, pp. 19-24, (2020); Hoellthaler, Georg, Digital Lean Production-An Approach to Identify Potentials for the Migration to a Digitalized Production System in SMEs from a Lean Perspective, Procedia CIRP, 67, pp. 522-527, (2018); Faishal, Muhammad Rama, APPLICATION OF LEAN LAYOUT PLANNING TO REDUCE WASTE IN A SLIPPERS MANUFACTURING: A CASE STUDY, Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 17, 3, pp. 55-68, (2023); Ishak, Anuar Bin, APPLICATION OF LEAN SIX SIGMA FOR ENHANCING PERFORMANCE IN THE POULTRY WASTEWATER TREATMENT, Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 16, 2, pp. 53-66, (2022); Cifone, Fabiana Dafne, ‘Lean 4.0’: How can digital technologies support lean practices?, International Journal of Production Economics, 241, (2021); Hoellthaler, Georg, Function framework for describing digital technologies in the context of lean production, Procedia CIRP, 88, pp. 167-172, (2020); Davis, Nathaniel, 4th Industrial Revolution Design Through Lean Foundation, Procedia CIRP, 91, pp. 306-311, (2020); Meissner, Alyssa, Digitalization as a catalyst for lean production: A learning factory approach for digital shop floor management, Procedia Manufacturing, 23, pp. 81-86, (2018); Kurdve, Martin, Digital assembly instruction system design with green lean perspective-Case study from building module industry, Procedia CIRP, 72, pp. 762-767, (2018); Hoellthaler, Georg, Requirements for a methodology for the assessment and selection of technologies of digitalization for lean production systems, Procedia CIRP, 79, pp. 198-203, (2019)","","Penerbit Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","19853157; 22898107","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203276764"

Finally, the narratives of members of the interest groups are presented, giving prominence to former Canopy Growth workers who, share their first-hand experiences in the corporation. The conclusions demonstrate the multiple inconsistencies that Canopy Growth embodies when raising the concept of social responsibility in its media discourses. These were evidenced by personnel who worked for the corporation in the city of Smiths Falls, Ontario.

The broadcasting industry is expected to be able to participate directly. This participation does not only stop at fundraising actions and sporadic public donation management, but also plays a role as a representative of private corporate institutions that actively and continuously contributes to the support for achieving the national development goals through implementation of the so-called people-centered, participatory, empowering, and sustainable paradigm, within the context of a mosque organizational environment. Theoretical Framework: The community empowerment theory used in this research process was dominated by the resource mobilization theory. Viewed from the community empowerment framework, the mobilization theory was appropriate to be applied in this research, as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to the ethical actions of companies or the business world that aim to improve the economy for the quality life of the employees, the communities, and the corporate environment. Method: This descriptive qualitative research employed a case study strategy which aims to analyse the da'wah activities in the mosque through TVKU CSR programs that support the transformation of the da'wah activities at the MAJT Great Mosque. Furthermore, the thematic interviews for data collection included the CSR program strategy carried out, the process and stages of the mosque youth empowerment, the mosque community, the mosque broadcasting community, and the independent mosque broadcasting-business unit. The collected research data were then analyzed by using the Corporate Societal Marketing (CSM) approach and through the application of the Atlas.ti software. Results and Discussion: Through the CSR program carried out by the Campus TVKU Semarang at the MAJT Great Mosque, the research findings showed a significant success in building an empowerment pattern entity that transforms innovative steps towards a positive impact for increasing empowered human development at the MAJT Great Mosque. From the convergence model pattern, several steps were then recommended based on the stages that occurred both in the application of technology (adoption process, new technology, and attitude formation) and media integration (computing, communication, and content) in the model. This is in line with the spirit of the emerging empowerment principles on people-center, participation, empowerment, and sustainability. Research Implications: This research theoretically develops the application of Corporate Social Responsibility and the society empowerment, while empirically, this research proposes to encourage the mosque youth comunity to be independent and creative in managing and producing contents of the significant mosque programs, and to encourage Campus TV’s to developp their innovative contents from the conventional practices into the digital practices. Originality/Value: The findings of this sustainability project research from the collaboration between a campus TV and a great mosque are expected to be able to build an empowerment pattern entity that transforms innovative steps and has the potential to have a positive impact in spreading the message of da'wah to the younger generation.","Convergence; Development; Human Empowerment; Mosque Youth Community; Transformation","","","Qualitative Media Analysis, (1996); New Normal Era Authorship, (2021); Poverty and Livelihoods Whose Reality Counts, (1995); Optimization of the Management of the Digital Philosophy of Maqashid Perspective the Qur an, (2021); Cannibals with Forks the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business, (1997); Empowering People at Work, (1994); Media Convergence and Globalization, (2017); Convergence Culture Where Old and New Media Collide, (2006); Jimu, Ignasio Malizani, Community development: A cross-examination of theory and practice using experiences in rural Malawi, Africa Development/Afrique et Developpement, 33, 2, pp. 23-35, (2008); Corporate Social Responsibility Doing the Most Good for Your Company and Your Cause, (2005)","","ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao","1981982X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202039666"

Although Nike claims to be committed to protecting consumer rights, promoting employee equality and environmental protection in digital technology innovation, many social responsibility issues remain. This paper offers two suggestions to help Nike better fulfill its CSR in the digital transformation process, including strengthening the visualization of social responsibility disclosure and increasing media attention to promote active corporate social responsibility. Through in-depth exploration and discussion of Nike’s social responsibility issues, combined with previous scholars’ research, this paper summarizes the main reasons for the company’s social responsibility issues in the digital transformation process and puts forward relevant recommendations.

By analyzing empirical data from various financial institutions, the study aims to elucidate how diversification into non-interest income streams influences risk profiles and overall financial stability. Furthermore, it explores the role of digital technologies in enhancing risk management strategies and driving profitability. This research explores how non-interest income, risk management, and digital technologies collectively impact profit maximization and revenue generation in commercial banks, addressing gaps in understanding these relationships. The findings provide insights for enhancing adaptive strategies and theoretical frameworks within commercial banking literature. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study begins with a thematic literature review to establish a theoretical foundation. Thematic analysis of the literature informs the development of interview questions for in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 industry experts, providing rich qualitative data. The research adopts a thematic frequency analysis methodology to categorize and interpret both the literature and interview findings, ensuring a holistic exploration of the research objectives. Findings reveal a complex interdependence between digital technologies, non-interest income, risk management, profit maximization, and commercial banking revenue streams, with digital transformations emerging as pivotal drivers. The study underscores the importance of adaptive risk management amid cybersecurity threats and strategic corporate social responsibility integration for long-term financial success.

The relevance of the topic is substantiated by the serious challenges modern businesses face regarding climate change, ecological sustainability, and social responsibility. The present study aims to prove that in the conditions of increasing public and corporate interest in environmental issues, organizations are brought to a growing need to adapt their business models by incorporating sustainability principles. Investors, regulators and consumers are directing their attention towards companies demonstrating commitment to environmental and social standards. The following research tasks have to be settled for reaching the above-mentioned goal: 1. to research the impact of the chemical industry on the environment; 2. to research the evolution of the way business is conducted; 3. to determine the extent of compliance of the business model of companies in the chemical industry with Sustainable Development Goals; 4. to identify new professions and roles in the context of environmental management for business needs. In the course of the study shall be justified the thesis that the combination of digital technologies, ethical principles and sustainability strategies provides Bulgarian companies in the chemical industry with the opportunity to adapt to current challenges, developing innovative business models, resp. meet regulatory requirements, create added value, competitive advantages and long-term sustainability. The methodology of questionnaire survey was used. The sample was formed by the method of random non-recurrent selection. The results of the research are expressed in the identification of best practices to serve as catalysts for balancing economic profitability and environmental responsibility.

A comprehensive review of empirical literature on the impact of ESG and CSR on economic indicators is presented, discussing studies focused on the Bloomberg ESG Disclosure Score. The importance of ESG in digital versus traditional environments is explored, considering the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by businesses in these operational realms. The study seeks to fill the gap in the literature by examining how ESG considerations shape the economic performance of companies in both digital and traditional settings. Ultimately, this research aims to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making and foster a nuanced understanding of the role ESG plays in shaping the trajectories of businesses.","Business Models; Csr; Digital Marketing; Digital Transformation; E-commerce; Economic Performance; Esg; Esg Index Providers; Rating Agencies; Sustainability","","Supported by grant No. V\u0160E IGS F5/14/2024 of the Internal Grant Agency by Faculty of Economics, Prague University of Economics and Business.

This paper explains how organisations can achieve this by joining the governance of science-driven capital projects. The research addresses two significant gaps: the limited academic understanding of how science-driven capital projects create social value and the empirical lack of guidelines for companies to harness these projects. The empirical setting is the space sector, specifically the International Space Station (ISS) project. We adopted a two-stage research design. First, based on public documents and reports, we investigated the governance and social value of projects developed on the ISS, finding that social value is created through ""In-Space"" and ""On-Earth&#x201D; projects. Second, we performed a thematic analysis of 18 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, obtaining a roadmap to create and claim social value by joining the governance of the ISS. The paper contributes to the theory by explaining how science-driven capital projects create social value and their key governance elements. We show that space is becoming accessible to many non-space companies. We contribute to practice by clarifying the main governance elements of science-driven capital projects and providing a roadmap to create and claim social value by joining their governance.","Companies; Complex Project Business; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Technologies; Emerging Technologies; Environmental, Social And Governance (esg); Innovation; International Space Station; Low Earth Orbit; Nasa; Project Strategy; Sdgs; Sociology; Space Vehicles; Stakeholders; Sustainable Development; Triple Bottom Line; Earth (planet); Economic And Social Effects; Environmental Technology; Joining; Orbits; Space Stations; Sustainable Development; Complex Programs; Complex Project Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Earth Orbits; Emerging Technologies; Environmental, Social And Governance; Innovation; International Space Stations; Low Earth Orbit; Project Business; Project Strategy; Sdg; Space Vehicles; Stakeholder; Triple Bottom Line; Nasa","Earth (planet); Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Joining; Orbits; Space stations; Sustainable development; Complex programs; Complex project business; Corporate social responsibility; Digital technologies; Earth orbits; Emerging technologies; Environmental, social and governance; Innovation; International Space stations; Low earth orbit; Project business; Project strategy; SDG; Space vehicles; Stakeholder; Triple Bottom Line; NASA","Funding text 1: Alessandro Paravano is a last-year PhD candidate at the School of Management at Politecnico di Milano, where he also works as a researcher in the Space Economy Observatory.

The direct, indirect and lasting repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and public health, as well as health systems can still be observed, even today. In the midst of the initial chaos, the role of tobacco as a prognostic factor for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes was largely neglected. As of 2023, numerous studies have confirmed that use of tobacco, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular and other diseases, is strongly associated with increased risks of severe COVID-19 complications (e.g., hospitalisation, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, long COVID, etc.) and deaths from COVID-19. In addition, evidence suggests that COVID-19 directly affects multiple organs beyond the respiratory system, disproportionately impacting individuals with comorbidities. Notably, people living with cardiovascular disease are more prone to experiencing worse outcomes, as COVID-19 often inherently manifests as thrombotic cardiovascular complications. As such, the triad of tobacco, COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease constitutes a dangerous cocktail. The lockdowns and social distancing measures imposed by governments have also had adverse effects on our lifestyles (e.g., shifts in diets, physical activity, tobacco consumption patterns, etc.) and mental well-being, all of which affect cardiovascular health. In particular, vulnerable populations are especially susceptible to tobacco use, cardiovascular disease and the psychological fallout from the pandemic. Therefore, national pandemic responses need to consider health equity as well as the social determinants of health. The pandemic has also had catastrophic impacts on many health systems, bringing some to the brink of collapse. As a result, many health services, such as services for cardiovascular disease or tobacco cessation, were severely disrupted due to fears of transmission and redirection of resources for COVID-19 care. Unfortunately, the return to pre-pandemic levels of cardiovascular disease care activity has stagnated. Nevertheless, digital solutions, such as telemedicine and apps, have flourished, and may help reduce the gaps. Advancing tobacco control was especially challenging due to interference from the tobacco industry. The industry exploited lingering uncertainties to propagate misleading information on tobacco and COVID-19 in order to promote its products. Regrettably, the links between tobacco use and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain inconclusive. However, a robust body of evidence has, since then, demonstrated that tobacco use is associated with more severe COVID-19 illness and complications. Additionally, the tobacco industry also repeatedly attempted to forge partnerships with governments under the guise of corporate social responsibility. The implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control could address many of the aforementioned challenges and alleviate the burden of tobacco, COVID-19, and cardiovascular disease. In particular, the implementation of Article 5.3 could protect public health policies from the vested interests of the industry. The world can learn from the COVID-19 pandemic to better prepare for future health emergencies of international concern. In light of the impact of tobacco on the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that tobacco control remains a central component in pandemic preparedness and response plans.","Cardiovascular Disease; Covid-19; Tobacco; Article; Artificial Ventilation; Cardiovascular Disease; Cardiovascular Risk; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Corporate Social Responsibility; Diet; Disease Burden; Disease Severity; Government; Health Care System; Health Equity; Hospitalization; Human; Intensive Care Unit; Lifestyle; Lockdown; Long Covid; Pandemic; Pandemic Preparedness; Physical Activity; Prognosis; Psychological Well-being; Public Policy; Risk Assessment; Risk Factor; Smoking Cessation; Social Determinants Of Health; Social Distancing; Telemedicine; Thrombosis; Tobacco Consumption; Tobacco Control; Tobacco Industry; Tobacco Use; Vulnerable Population; Epidemiology; Health Care Policy; Prevention And Control; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Cardiovascular Diseases; Covid-19; Health Policy; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors; Sars-cov-2; Tobacco Use","Article; artificial ventilation; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; corporate social responsibility; diet; disease burden; disease severity; government; health care system; health equity; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; lifestyle; lockdown; long COVID; pandemic; pandemic preparedness; physical activity; prognosis; psychological well-being; public policy; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking cessation; social determinants of health; social distancing; telemedicine; thrombosis; tobacco consumption; tobacco control; tobacco industry; tobacco use; vulnerable population; epidemiology; health care policy; prevention and control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Cardiovascular Diseases; COVID-19; Health Policy; Humans; Pandemics; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Tobacco Use","","Gbd Compare Glob Burd Dis, (2019); Health Consequences of Smoking Nicotine Addiction A Report of the Surgeon General, (1988); Hirvonen, Eveliina, Documentation of the patient’s smoking status in common chronic diseases–analysis of medical narrative reports using the ULMFiT based text classification, European Clinical Respiratory Journal, 8, 1, (2021); WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Conference of the Parties Ninth Session Decision Declaration on WHO Fctc and Recovery from the Covid 19 Pandemic 2021; Reddy, Rohin Kumar, The effect of smoking on COVID-19 severity: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Medical Virology, 93, 2, pp. 1045-1056, (2021); Yang, Jing, Prevalence of comorbidities and its effects in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 94, pp. 91-95, (2020); Guo, Tao, Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), JAMA Cardiology, 5, 7, pp. 811-818, (2020); Mohamed, Mohamed Osama, Long COVID and cardiovascular disease: a learning health system approach, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 19, 5, pp. 287-288, (2022); Cureus, (2020); Lukassen, Sören, SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells, EMBO Journal, 39, 10, (2020)","","Ubiquity Press","22118179; 22118160","","","38973985","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198062319"

This study mainly seeks to analyse the presence of social commitment and sustainability in the list of advertising awards, both in the categories/subcategories and special prizes of these, and in the creative concept of the winning campaigns. The methodology is based on a content analysis of the list of winners of 29 advertising awards, which comprise 1,558 awards granted to 892 actions. Although not in every case, committed speech is rewarded in most advertising festivals with categories and subcategories related to social and environmental issues. In addition, the results reveal the prominent presence in the awards’ list of winners of advertising strategies inspired by the commitment to society and the planet, not only in those related categories, but also in others. From the analysis of the creative concept of these actions based on the Big Ideal (Ogilvy), the main thematic blocks are identified: ecology, awareness of certain diseases, social causes and the visibility of diversity.

The academic study and application of ethics in marketing processes has been the subject of study since the very beginnings of marketing itself. But most theories of ethics in marketing have focused on large companies or business corporations. Small companies have mostly tried to adopt the marketing processes and actions of large companies, and this has made it impossible for them to apply their own ethical processes in the marketing of their companies. And even more so when these processes are characterised by the search for the common good, social marketing, environmental or corporate social responsibility. We should add to this the fact that communication between large companies and their customers is largely digital. Small companies do not seek ethical processes in their digital communication, but they rather copy the big companies. In this sense, it is crucial to propose an answer to how we can generate ethical marketing in small companies and how it can generate increased sales.","Ethics And Marketing; Marketing And Society; Marketing Philosophy; Small Business","","","Agag, Gomaa, E-commerce Ethics and Its Impact on Buyer Repurchase Intentions and Loyalty: An Empirical Study of Small and Medium Egyptian Businesses, Journal of Business Ethics, 154, 2, pp. 389-410, (2019); Clio America, (2010); Etica De La Empresa, (1994); Annals of the Royal Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, (2019); Cecilia, Maria, Small-Sized Suppliers Entering Large Markets: An Ethical Initiative of the Caras do Brasil Program, Journal of Business Ethics, 112, 4, pp. 685-696, (2013); Dunfee, Thomas W., Social contracts and marketing ethics, Journal of Marketing, 63, 3, pp. 14-32, (1999); Journal of Marketing, (1985); Ciencia Y Tecnica Como Ideologia, (1984); Teoria De La Accion Comunicativa, (1987); Non Things Bankruptciesoftodaysworld, (2021)","","Universitat Ramon Llull","20138393; 2229578X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196658021"

Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized, transparent, and immutable characteristics, is at the heart of this transformation. This paper explores the potential and challenges of integrating blockchain into Industry 4.0, focusing on economic and management innovations. Blockchain’s impact on sustainability reporting and corporate performance monitoring is profound, offering unprecedented transparency and trustworthiness. It enables granular insights into operations, fostering a responsible business ecosystem and equitable ecological accountability. However, aligning blockchain incentives with value-based objectives is crucial to avoid unintended consequences. Environmental concerns regarding blockchain’s energy consumption, especially in public blockchains like Bitcoin, highlight the need to balance innovation with ecological responsibility. Scalability remains a challenge, necessitating innovative solutions such as proof-of-stake. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainties and trust dynamics pose significant barriers to blockchain adoption. The paper emphasizes the importance of addressing these systemic challenges for the seamless integration of blockchain into economic and managerial ecosystems.

In the information society, the network economy is emerging as a new, paradigmatic economic order. With the ability to share information quickly and cheaply on a global scale, the importance of centralised decision-making and costly corporate structures is diminishing. Companies are giving way to interconnected networks, and the concept of ownership is gradually being replaced by the concept of access rights. From a company law perspective, this shift to the network economy leads to the emergence of new forms of governance. As access rights replace ownership, the governance of these rights becomes paramount for economic actors, but it transcends company boundaries and is instead rooted in contractual relationships. As a result, contract governance is gradually replacing corporate governance. With governance frameworks extending beyond the firm to contractual networks, directors’ duties are likely to extend beyond firm-specific boundaries to bridge the responsibility gap created by the increasing use of data technologies.","Access Rights; Business Judgment Rule; Contractual Governance; Corporate Boundaries; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Data Technologies; Digital Transformation; Directors’ Duties; Network Economy; Responsibility Gap","","","","","Kluwer Law International","09596941; 1875841X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195052213"

Design/methodology/approach: Using panel data for 126 different brands over 10 years, we empirically analyse the impact of ESG performance on brand value, considering the moderating role of the digitalisation level. Findings/results: Firstly, the impact of ESG performance on brand value exhibits a U-shaped relationship. Secondly, the digitalisation level negatively moderates the U-shaped relationship. Thirdly, the effect of ESG performance on brand value is mainly on the sub-items of environment and social responsibility, while the effect of governance is not significant. Practical implications: Firstly, firms should recognise the complex relationship between ESG performance and brand value, and strive to find a balance between economic benefits and sustainable development. Secondly, firms can utilise digital technology and platforms to communicate and interact with consumers, integrating ESG principles into their daily brand activities. Thirdly, investments in environmental and social responsibility are more meaningful for improving brand value. Originality/value: Firstly, our study adds value to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG literature by investigating the non-linear impact of ESG performance on brand value. Secondly, we replenish the mechanistic study about how ESG performance affects brand value. Thirdly, we open the black box of the effect of single indicators (E/S/G) on brand value, including the specific direction and strength.","Brand Value; Digitalisation Level; Esg Performance; Reputation Signals; U-shaped Relationshi","","This research received a specific grant from Chaohu University\u2019s Quality Engineering Project Number ch19zhkt03.","Aaker, David A., The Value of Brand Equity, Journal of Business Strategy, 13, 4, pp. 27-32, (1992); Aaker, David A., Measuring Brand Equity Across Products and Markets, California Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 102-120, (1996); Agus Harjoto, Maretno Agus, Strategic and institutional sustainability: corporate social responsibility, brand value, and Interbrand listing, Journal of Product and Brand Management, 26, 6, pp. 545-558, (2017); Ailawadi, Kusum L., Revenue Premium as an Outcome Measure of Brand Equity, Journal of Marketing, 67, 4, pp. 1-17, (2003); Andersen, Mette, Corporate social responsibility in global supply chains, Supply Chain Management, 14, 2, pp. 75-86, (2009); Aouadi, Amal, Do ESG Controversies Matter for Firm Value?

This generation prioritises environmental and social concerns, compelling companies to adopt honesty and transparency in their products, processes, and values. Millennials are inclined to support brands that demonstrate social responsibility, sustainability, and ethical practices. Consequently, brand values have become pivotal, shaping consumer perceptions and behaviours. These values reflect the beliefs and principles a brand embodies, significantly impacting consumer perceptions and behaviours toward it.

During this technological evolution, the alignment and harmonization of core values have become paramount. Value harmonization in the digital age is a complex and dynamic process that seeks to unify fundamental principles across individuals, organizations, and societies within this rapidly changing landscape. In this abstract, we explore the multifaceted dimensions of value harmonization, acknowledging its ethical, cultural, and societal implications. The abstract underscores the importance of creating a global framework for shared values while respecting diverse cultural norms. It highlights the need for inclusivity, cybersecurity, and education to ensure that digital technologies are accessible, secure, and used responsibly. The ethical dilemmas posed by technology, such as privacy concerns and algorithmic biases, are also recognized. Regulations and corporate responsibility are seen as pivotal elements in guiding ethical behavior, as businesses and governments play crucial roles in shaping the digital environment. Striking a balance between technological innovation and value upholding is a main challenge. Ultimately, the abstract emphasizes that value harmonization is an ongoing, adaptive process. It calls for the continuous evolution of ethical frameworks that evolve in step with technology. In a world where digital technologies are increasingly pervasive, value harmonization is not a mere option; it is a necessity. The abstract underscores that it is only through a collective commitment to fundamental values that the full potential of digital technologies can be harnessed, ensuring their enhancement of our lives, societies, and the world as a whole.","Conceptual Model; Digital Age; Harmonization; Value; Engineering Education; Alignment And Harmonization; Complex Processes; Conceptual Model; Core Values; Digital Age; Digital Technologies; Harmonisation; Technological Advancement; Technological Evolution; Value; Ethical Technology","Engineering education; Alignment and harmonization; Complex Processes; Conceptual model; Core values; Digital age; Digital technologies; Harmonisation; Technological advancement; Technological evolution; Value; Ethical technology","The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the German Academy of Sciences for the invaluable support provided to the VIMACS project.

Surveying n=395 customers through online questionnaires, the analysis reveals a positive correlation between philanthropic initiatives and heightened customer satisfaction and loyalty, underscoring the potential for banks to strategically engage in such endeavors. The partial least squares (Smart-PLS) analysis is used to run the measurement and structural models. Notably, the study recommends the utilization of social media programs as a practical avenue within the philanthropic responsibility framework, recognizing them as highly effective tools for customer outreach in the intensely competitive Jordanian banking sector. This integration aligns with the broader recommendation to adopt a customer-centric approach, addressing overlooked needs, and maximizing the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) dimensions on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Specifically, the paper explores the impact of digital platforms on the sustainable development practices of enterprises, seeking to comprehend how these platforms influence the implementation of environmental protection policies, resource management, and social responsibility initiatives. Methods: To assess the impact of digital platforms on corporate environmental behavior, we conducted a questionnaire survey targeting employees in private enterprises. This survey aimed to evaluate the relationship between the adoption of digital platforms and the implementation of environmental protection policies and practices. Results: Analysis of the survey responses revealed a significant positive correlation between the use of digital platforms and the environmental protection behavior of enterprises ((Formula presented.)), Moreover, the presence of innovative environmental protection technologies on these platforms was found to positively influence the enforcement of environmental policies, with a calculated impact ratio of ((Formula presented.)). An intermediary analysis highlighted that environmental innovation technology plays a mediating role in this process. Additionally, adjustment analysis showed that enterprises of various sizes and industries respond differently to digital platforms, indicating the need for tailored environmental policies Discussion: These findings underscore the pivotal role of digital platforms in enhancing CSR efforts and public health by fostering improved environmental practices among corporations. The mediating effect of environmental innovation technologies suggests that digital platforms not only facilitate direct environmental actions but also enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of such initiatives through technological advances. The variability in response by different enterprises points to the importance of customizable strategies in policy formulation.

To develop recommendations for the corporate digital responsibility (CDR) strategy aimed at increasing the level of integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and information systems (IS) of the company. To develop a mathematical model of coordination decisions regarding CSR with production and business activities of companies. Methodology. The introduction of the methods of: logical generalization made it possible to define CDR adapted to Ukrainian realities; analysis and synthesis – to point out the need to integrate CSR with IS; comparative analysis – to determine directions, tasks, requirements for the implementation of CDR; logical abstraction – to substantiate the need to implement strategy for CDR implementation, develop its stages, tasks and goals of each stages; mathematical analysis – to develop mathematical model of coordination of management decisions. Findings. A definition of CDR, adapted to Ukrainian reality, which became the conceptual basis of the presented research, is proposed. The need for integration of CSR and IS and the formation of a new mechanism – CDR, as a result of the evolution of CSR, is substantiated. The directions, tasks, and requirements for the implementation of CDR are defined. The need to implement the strategy for the implementation of CDR are substantiated, its stages, tasks and goals of each stage are developed. It is indicated that the integration of CSR and IS can take place iteratively, with management gaining experience and finding optimal methods and tools. Originality. A mathematical model that allows one not only to coordinate various management decisions, but also to forecast their short-term and long-term results, is developed. Practical value. The proposed approach to CDR strategy formation will increase the effectiveness of CDR and improve the integration of CSR and IS. The developed mathematical model will allow one not only to solve the problem of coordination of management decisions, but will also help to economically spend IT resources and speed up the delivery of results.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Information Systems; Management; Mathematical Model","","","Market Infrastructure, (2019); Orbik, Zbigniew, Corporate Social and Digital Responsibility, Management Systems in Production Engineering, 27, 2, pp. 79-83, (2019); Hanelt, Andre, A Systematic Review of the Literature on Digital Transformation: Insights and Implications for Strategy and Organizational Change, Journal of Management Studies, 58, 5, pp. 1159-1197, (2021); Atanasov, Atanas, Integration of Digital Technologies in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Activities: A Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, 8, (2023); Hakimi, Abdelaziz, Corporate social responsibility and firm performance: a threshold analysis of European firms, European Journal of Management and Business Economics, 34, 3, pp. 282-299, (2025); Fenech, Roberta, The changing role of human resource management in an era of digital transformation, Journal of Management Information and Decision Science, 22, 2, pp. 176-180, (2019); Ekonomika Ta Derzhava, (2019); Law Business and Sustainability Herald, (2021); Mihale-Wilson, Cristina A., Corporate Digital Responsibility: Relevance and Opportunities for Business and Information Systems Engineering, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 64, 2, pp. 127-132, (2022); Mueller, Benjamin, Corporate Digital Responsibility, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 64, 5, pp. 689-700, (2022)","","Natsional'nyi Hirnychyi Universytet","22232362; 20712227","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190747010"

There is a critical need to investigate how technology may be used in CSR programs at private institutes of higher learning in this period of rapid technological innovation. This study examines the opportunities, challenges, and implications of using technology to improve CSR programs in private universities. Digital platforms in universities improve stakeholder engagement, enable data-driven CSR decisions, and promote the growth of creative and scalable social programs involving faculty and students. However, incorporating technology into CSR projects also poses considerable challenges. Privacy and security issues must be carefully considered when gathering and analysing sensitive data. Furthermore, the digital gap can prevent some communities from benefiting from digitally driven CSR initiatives. Another issue is upholding authenticity and coordinating technologically enabled CSR efforts with institutional principles and objectives. This paper examines case studies and highlights their impacts to shed light on the effects of incorporating technology into CSR initiatives at private institutions. The influence on stakeholder participation, the success of CSR activities, and the institution's general reputation are all examined.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Gap; Digital Platforms; Private Institutes; E-learning; Economic And Social Effects; Engineering Education; Social Aspects; Core Components; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Gap; Digital Platforms; Higher Learning; Learning Opportunity; Private Institute; Technological Innovation; Well Being; Sensitive Data","E-learning; Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Social aspects; Core components; Corporate social responsibility; Digital gap; Digital platforms; Higher learning; Learning opportunity; Private institute; Technological innovation; Well being; Sensitive data","","International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2019); Senin, Muhammad Adam, Corporate social responsibility (Csr) for education in malaysia: A systematic literature review, International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation, 23, 3, pp. 631-637, (2019); Loh, Ngiik Hoon, Corporate social responsibility (Csr) towards education: The application and possibility of 3d hologram to enhance cognitive skills of primary school learners, International Journal of Business and Society, 20, 3, pp. 1036-1047, (2019); Jain, Namita, Stimulating CSR learning collaboration by the mentor universities with digital tools and technologies – an empirical study during the COVID-19 pandemic, Management Decision, 60, 10, pp. 2824-2848, (2022); How Corporate Social Responsibility Affects Brand Equity and Loyalty A Comparison Between Private and Public Universities, (2022); Rahman, Aminah Abdul, Corporate social responsibility in higher education: A study of the institutionalisation of CSR in Malaysian public universities, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 26, 4, pp. 916-928, (2019); Cardinali, Pier Giacomo, Responsible digitalization through digital technologies and green practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 4, pp. 984-995, (2022); Resnik, David B., The Ethical Challenges of Socially Responsible Science, Accountability in Research, 23, 1, pp. 31-46, (2016); Technology Integration A Review of the Literature, (2007); Mattera, Marina, Facing TBL with IoT: creating value and positively impacting business processes, Social Responsibility Journal, 18, 1, pp. 178-201, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798350372229","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190520087"

While previous studies have extensively explored Chinese FDI in resource-rich sectors, this paper focuses on the unique challenges and opportunities in a developed country like Japan, which shares similar technological capabilities with China. In particular, we investigate the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in mediating the efficiency of Chinese companies’ investments in Japan. As China’s economy continues to grow globally, understanding the effectiveness of its FDI activities has become increasingly important. This study employs a comprehensive approach, drawing insights from various academic perspectives, including digital finance, product market competition, education systems, energy intensity, logistical capability, and green credit policies, to provide a holistic view of Chinese FDI in Japan. Our findings emphasize the pivotal role of CSR in enhancing investment efficiency and mitigating challenges faced by Chinese firms in Japan. We highlight how CSR positively influences organizational trust, credibility, and risk management, ultimately improving investment effectiveness. Additionally, resource-based theory studies reveal the connection between CSR, technological innovation, and corporate growth, further enhancing investment efficiency. This research, grounded in stakeholder and information asymmetry theories, utilizes robust statistical methods and a rich dataset to establish and validate hypotheses. The results underscore the significance of CSR as a mediating factor and its positive impact on Chinese companies’ FDI efficiency in Japan. This study aligns with the principles of the knowledge economy and provides practical insights for policymakers in China and Japan. Both nations can foster a conducive environment for sustainable and mutually beneficial international collaborations in the global marketplace by promoting CSR practices and recognizing their influence on investment efficiency.","Chinese Companies; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Descriptive Statistics; Foreign Direct Investment (fdi) Efficiency; Richardson’s Investment Expectation Mode; Socially Responsible Practices","","This article was supported by the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department: Research on China\u2019s National Image Reported by Japanese Media in the Post-epidemic Era (Program No. 21JK0289).","Abad-Segura, Emilio, The sustainable approach to corporate social responsibility: A global analysis and future trends, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 19, (2019); International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2021); Bardy, Roland, Foreign Investment and Ethics: How to Contribute to Social Responsibility by Doing Business in Less-Developed Countries, Journal of Business Ethics, 106, 3, pp. 267-282, (2012); Benlemlih, Mohammed, Corporate Social Responsibility and Investment Efficiency, Journal of Business Ethics, 148, 3, pp. 647-671, (2018); Bergh, Donald D., Information Asymmetry in Management Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Opportunities, Journal of Management, 45, 1, pp. 122-158, (2019); Blowfield, Michael E., Setting new agendas: Critical perspectives on Corporate Social Responsibility in the developing world, International Affairs, 81, 3, pp. 499-513, (2005); Boubaker, Sabri, Competitive pressure and firm investment efficiency: Evidence from corporate employment decisions, European Financial Management, 28, 1, pp. 113-161, (2022); Bouichou, Said Id, How Corporate Social Responsibility Boosts Corporate Financial and Non-financial Performance: The Moderating Role of Ethical Leadership, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Brammer, Steve J., The contribution of corporate social responsibility to organizational commitment, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 18, 10, pp. 1701-1719, (2007); Branco, Manuel Castelo, Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives, Journal of Business Ethics, 69, 2, pp. 111-132, (2006)","","Springer","18687873; 18687865","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189920444"

This study investigates the relationship between CSR, customer engagement, and green consumer loyalty, with a focus on the banking industry in Pakistan. Additionally, it explores the mediating role of perceived environmental value and the moderating effect of customer eco-consciousness, within the context of green banking digitalization. Structural equation modeling is employed for data analysis. Findings reveal that CSR positively influences consumer loyalty, with customer engagement partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, perceived environmental value mediates the association between CSR and green consumer loyalty, while customer eco-consciousness moderates this relationship.

However, PbD remains a voluntary initiative without any means to ensure its effective implementation. Article 25 GDPR codifies PbD as a legal obligation requiring technologies processing personal data to follow Data Protection by Design and by Default (DPbDD). However, Article 25 is only binding on controllers which limits its scope. For instance, the design of technologies may not coincide with the entry of the controller into the digital value chain. This implies that the burden of implementing DPbDD lies on the users of technology and not on its designers, questioning the true extent of protection by design if stages like product development and innovation are excluded. This paper explores the legislative motivation behind the personal scope of Article 25. A holistic interpretation of Article 25 in light of other provisions of the GDPR shows a possibility, albeit not direct, to influence the design phase of technologies. However, it remains unclear whether this possibility ensures a co-division of responsibility. To address this, we propose examining corporate supply chain due diligence, specifically the due diligence obligations of mother companies for actions of their subsidiaries and business relationships.","Data Protection By Design And By Default (dpbdd); Privacy By Design (pbd); Responsibility Of Data Controllers","","This work has been funded under the TReSPAsS-ETN Project, part of H2020 Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions [grant number 860813].

Using a simple random sampling technique, data from 294 textile manufacturing SMEs is collected and analyzed using the structural equation model (SEM) in AMOS v.24. The results indicated that digital technologies, tax avoidance, green employee behavior, and corporate social responsibility facilitated improving the SFP of SMEs. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the link connecting TA and SFP is unaffected by CSR activities aimed at the environment. This finding, however, should not lessen the importance of TA, which deserves significant attention and thought from management.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Green Employee Behavior; Sustainable Firm Performance; Tax Avoidance; Antidotes; Antidote; Commercial Phenomena; Digital Technology; Gross National Product; Methodology; Antidotes; Commerce; Digital Technology; Gross Domestic Product; Research Design","antidote; commercial phenomena; digital technology; gross national product; methodology; Antidotes; Commerce; Digital Technology; Gross Domestic Product; Research Design","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","","38102435","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182954153"

Prior research has examined corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives as actions that may be susceptible to opportunistic conduct by managers, which may be observed via earnings management. This research aims to investigate different perspectives of earnings quality (EQ) by examining the determinants of EQ described as inherent operating environment and risk of the industry business process (innate factors of EQ) and management reporting decision (manager’s discretion of EQ). Separating the components of EQ determinants individually is considered an advantage by the previous researcher. Using fixed effect panel data, this study demonstrates that ESG performance is positively associated with discretionary accruals and negatively related to innate earnings quality. This phenomenon might perhaps be attributed to the challenges posed by the sector, characterized by rapid digital transformation and unexpected digital development in the markets. This observation suggests that over time, the utilization of symbolic ESG business practices, which are susceptible to greenwashing, would have a detrimental effect on the fundamental earnings quality influenced by the operational context and the risk of uncertainty associated with the organization.","Digital; Discretionary; Earnings Quality; Environment; Esg; Governance; Innate Earnings Quality; Social","","","Adams, Carol A., Integrating sustainability reporting into management practices, Accounting Forum, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2008); Impact of Symbolic and Substantive Actions on Environmental Legitimacy, (2009); Bozzolan, Saverio, Corporate Social Responsibility and Earnings Quality: International Evidence, International Journal of Accounting, 50, 4, pp. 361-396, (2015); Branco, Manuel Castelo, Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives, Journal of Business Ethics, 69, 2, pp. 111-132, (2006); Academy of Management Review, (1979); Chang, Victor I., How Blockchain can impact financial services – The overview, challenges and recommendations from expert interviewees, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 158, (2020); Chih, Hsianglin, Corporate social responsibility, investor protection, and earnings management: Some international evidence, Journal of Business Ethics, 79, 1-2, pp. 179-198, (2008); undefined, (2021); Review of Accounting; de la Fuente-Herrero, Gabriel, The value of a firm's engagement in ESG practices: Are we looking at the right side?, Long Range Planning, 55, 4, (2022)","","University of Wollongong","18342019; 18342000","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182679307"

Successful companies need to be socially responsible to acquire competitive advantage for their business. In this way, they may strengthen their brand, improve their reputation and credibility via-a-vis customers, suppliers etc. The COVID-19 pandemic and its implications forced companies to adopt social responsibility initiatives by online and digital platforms. This in turn, led to interesting implications for the entire concept of CSR. This digitally enhanced dimension of CSR shall be referred to in this paper as digital social responsibility (DSR). In this context the objective of this paper is to examine the impact of DSR on: Brand Image (BI), Spending Habits (SH), Product Involvement (PI), and Technology Adoption (TA) on consumers’ purchasing behavior (CPB) through the mediating role of digital marketing. By focusing on the case of Kuwait, a descriptive analysis approach, supported by online survey (convenience sampling) was employed to examine the issue. The analysis suggests that BI, SH and TA significantly impacted CPB, but PI did not have an impact on CPB. It was found that DSR variables have significantly impacted CPB through using DM as mediating variable.","Consumers’ Purchasing Behavior; Covid-19; Digital Social Responsibility (dsr)","","","Lee, Seoki, Do a company’s sincere intentions with CSR initiatives matter to employees?: A comparison of customer-related and employee-related CSR initiatives, Journal of Global Responsibility, 9, 4, pp. 355-371, (2018); Puriwat, Wilert, Customer Engagement with Digital Social Responsibility in Social Media: A Case Study of COVID-19 Situation in Thailand, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 2, pp. 475-483, (2021); Pakistan J Humanities Soc Sci, (2021); Kuwaits Digital Inequalities Report from Digital Skills to Tangible Outcomes Project Report, (2022); Saleh, Yasser, ICT, social media and COVID-19: evidence from informal home-based business community in Kuwait City, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 3, pp. 395-413, (2020); Hoang, Linhviet, Corporate Social Responsibility and Job Pursuit Intention of Employees in Vietnam, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 12, pp. 345-353, (2020); Puriwat, Wilert, Consumers’ Attitude towards Digital Social Responsibility: Impacts on Electronic Word of Mouth and Purchase Intention, Emerging Science Journal, 6, 1, pp. 64-74, (2022); Lacey, Russell W., Longitudinal Effects of Corporate Social Responsibility on Customer Relationships, Journal of Business Ethics, 97, 4, pp. 581-597, (2010); Fatma, Mobin, The effect of CSR engagement on eWOM on social media, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, 28, 4, pp. 941-956, (2020); Martin, Kirsten E., Trust and the Online Market Maker: A Comment on Etzioni’s Cyber Trust, Journal of Business Ethics, 156, 1, pp. 21-24, (2019)","Visvizi, A.; Visvizi, A.; Troisi, O.; Corvello, V.","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","22138684; 22138692","9783031349195; 9783031282751; 9783030395148; 9789811964138; 9783030620653; 9783030220549; 9783030152963; 9783030775162; 9783030961879; 9783031195594","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182004306"

An analysis of data from 306 NEV owners in four Chinese cities demonstrated that ECSR directly and indirectly, via green trust and green brand image, shapes green purchasing intentions positively. However, green self-concept consistency was found to weaken the connections ECSR, green trust, and green brand image. From a theoretical perspective, this exploration enhances our understanding of environmentally-driven micro-CSR (individual-level CSR) by shedding light on the factors influencing consumers' intentions to engage in green consumption (new energy) of high involvement products (vehicles). Noteworthily, this examination uncovers the social-psychological mechanisms that drive these intentions and underscores the significance of maintaining consistency in self-concept, particularly within collectivist societies. From a practical standpoint, this research offers valuable guidance for marketing approaches, particularly in the NEV sector, thereby contributing to SDG7 on clean energy and SDG12 on responsible consumption and production.","China; Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Green Brand Image; Green Buying Intention; Green Purchase Intention; Green Self-concept Consistency; Green Trust; New Energy Vehicle; Sdg12; Sdg7; Sdgs; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Digital Storage; Economic And Social Effects; Electric Vehicles; Sales; Brand Image; China; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Green Brand Image; Green Buying Intention; Green Purchase Intention; Green Self-concept Consistency; Green Trust; New Energy Vehicles; Purchase Intention; Sdg; Sdg12; Sdg7; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Development","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Sales; Brand image; China; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental corporate social responsibility; Green brand image; Green buying intention; Green purchase intention; Green self-concept consistency; Green trust; New energy vehicles; Purchase intention; SDG; SDG12; SDG7; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable development","","Ahmad, Fauziah Sh, Environmental quality awareness, green trust, green self-efficacy and environmental attitude in influencing green purchase behaviour, International Journal of Ethics and Systems, 38, 1, pp. 68-90, (2022); Ahmad, Wasim, Determinants of CSR and green purchase intention: Mediating role of customer green psychology during COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Cleaner Production, 389, (2023); Ahmad, Wasim, Green purchase intention: Effects of electronic service quality and customer green psychology, Journal of Cleaner Production, 267, (2020); Ahn, Jiseon, CSR perception and revisit intention: the roles of trust and commitment, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Insights, 3, 5, pp. 607-623, (2020); International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2021); Amin, Sanjida, Effect of consumption values on customers’ green purchase intention: a mediating role of green trust, Social Responsibility Journal, 17, 8, pp. 1320-1336, (2021); Asadi, Shahla, Factors impacting consumers’ intention toward adoption of electric vehicles in Malaysia, Journal of Cleaner Production, 282, (2021); Azmat, Fara, Convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability at the tipping point of the sustainable development goals, Journal of Business Research, 167, (2023); Bansal, Sanchita, Corporate social responsibility: Insights from COVID-19 and stakeholder theory, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 42, 6, pp. 154-169, (2023); Bashir, Shahid, Green Brand Benefits and Brand Outcomes: The Mediating Role of Green Brand Image, SAGE Open, 10, 3, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179011273"

We estimated that if water quality information is provided monthly, weekly, and daily, consumers are willing to pay an additional 28, 29, and 37 thousand VND per cubic metre, respectively. Consumers highly value the transparency of water quality information. High-income consumers are willing to pay more for water quality improvements and transparent water quality information. Further, having safe filter to drink water and potable tap water rather than unsafe drinking water equals an additional 5 and 7 thousand VND per cubic metre in customers’ willingness to pay. Consumers also prefer state-controlled water companies to private companies. In the case of private water companies, consumers also expect these companies to have a high level of awareness about their corporate social responsibility. The findings provide evidence that information transparency in water quality can be a powerful tool that fosters public awareness and holds water companies accountable. Consumers are willing to pay to get access to information on water quality regularly.

Leveraging the recent advances in textual analysis, we quantify the extent of a firm’s digital transformation. The results show that digital transformation enhances a firm’s ESG performance. Moreover, results remain robust after addressing endogeneity problems and several robustness tests. In addition, we validate potential mechanisms that the digital transformation mainly improves the ESG performance of firms by improving the level of environmental performance, corporate social responsibility, and corporate governance. To examine the economic consequence, we find that digital transformation gains more government subsidies and analysts’ attention increasing the management’s positive tone at the earnings communication conferences by improving the firm’s ESG performance.

This creates a responsiveness-responsibility dilemma that the European Commission has tried to navigate by constructing responsiveness to public demands for tax justice as a political imperative. In this article, I apply the concept of ‘political work' to analyse EU tax policy between 2014 and 2019 and show the ways in which the politics of responsiveness partly eroded the institutional constraints of responsibility vis-à-vis member states.

We use listed companies in Chinese heavily polluting industries from 2014 to 2020 as study samples and construct a fixed effect model for empirical testing. The findings reveal that the upgrading of corporate environmental strategy is positively incentivized by digital finance, and the influence channel of this incentive is to alleviate financing constraints. Meanwhile, lower managerial myopia and higher media attention can strengthen digital finance’s contribution to the corporate environmental strategy upgrade. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the empowering role of digital finance in the corporate environmental strategy upgrade is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, central and western regions, as well as areas with high environmental governance intensity.

Drawing on critical theories of (counter)publics, care work, and civil rights, we explore (1) civil society organizations’ negotiations with various stakeholders in the audits, (2) the perceived utility of the audits as a platform governance mechanism, and (3) motivations behind using a civil rights framework for auditing platforms. Based on interviews and textual analysis, we find that civil society used dualistic strategies, working with and against platforms to navigate corporate and government neglect of digital harms to marginalized communities and negotiate asymmetric power structures. Groups used the audits to urge platforms to respect civil rights law while asking them to address areas beyond the existing law. They also mobilized the audits to achieve immediate ‘harm reduction’ from the platforms while simultaneously advocating for government regulation by demonstrating the audits’ limitations. In the process, the civil society counterpublic faced challenges from the externalization of responsibility by platforms and the co-option and politicization of civil rights. As a result, we argue, the utility of the audits may ultimately lie in how their limitations and failure can be used by counterpublics to rearticulate responsibility for harm to marginalized communities in platform governance.","Auditing; Civil Rights; Civil Society; Counterpublic; Digital Harms; Platform Governance","","This work was supported by a USC Annenberg Summer Research Fellowship and a USC Dissertation Grant.

For this purpose, product development processes are already established in companies. However, these processes are typically based on mass products and are not necessarily suitable for individualized products. Hence, the question emerges of how to develop and manufacture individualized products in a corporate product development setup. The characteristics of individualized products and a multiple-case study in seven companies made apparent that product development processes for complex individualized products should be adapted according to the specific requirements and relate to specific product development methods. More specifically, results indicate that a prior definition and assurance of boundaries as well as free spaces through pretested products is key, as the validation stage is constrained for such products. Methods such as in-process monitoring, postprocessing, and responsibility sharing (co-design) and the use of expert tools foster such product development processes. That gives practitioners the possibility to develop and manufacture individualized products efficiently by adapting the product development process and using the right methods. Based on these results and the literature review, we propose a novel definition of individualized products and a holistic product development process that may support discussions of the relevance of mass individualization as a new paradigm.","Digital Manufacturing Technologies; Individualized Products (inpro); Mass Individualization (mi); Mass Personalization (mper); Product Development Methods (pdms); Product Development Process (pdp); Mechatronics; Process Monitoring; Product Design; Digital Manufacturing; Digital Manufacturing Technology; Individualisation; Individualized Product; Individualized Products; Interview; Manufacturing Technologies; Mass Individualization; Mass Personalization; Personalizations; Product Development Method; Product Development Methods; Product Development Process; Technological Innovation; Product Development","Mechatronics; Process monitoring; Product design; Digital manufacturing; Digital manufacturing technology; Individualisation; Individualized product; Individualized products; Interview; Manufacturing technologies; Mass individualization; Mass personalization; Personalizations; Product development method; Product development methods; Product development process; Technological innovation; Product development","","Anattasakul, Roatchanatam, Digital co-creation: an early-stage product individualization framework to bridge the customer-designer void, pp. 659-677, (2022); Customers Want Customization and Companies are Giving It to Them, (2020); Simpson, Timothy W., Preface, pp. v-x, (2014); Kuhl, Juliane, Strategies for customer satisfaction and customer requirement fulfillment within the trend of individualization, Procedia CIRP, 84, pp. 130-135, (2019); Staufen, (2017); Wright, Paul K., Condition monitoring in end-milling using wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Transactions of the North American Manufacturing Research Institute of SME, 36, pp. 177-183, (2008); Hodgins, Diana M., Healthy aims: Developing new medical implants and diagnostic equipment, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 7, 1, pp. 14-20, (2008); Liu, Xiaoyu, Design and implementation of a volume conduction based RFID system for smart implants, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 2893-2896, (2011); FDA, (2021); Venture Hacks Interview What is the Minimum Viable Product, (2009)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15580040; 00189391","","IEEMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161024472"

These issues are analyzed through the sustainability disclosure of the major cruise corporations. Under the lens of the corporate social responsibility framework and legitimacy theory, this study construed sustainability reports of four major cruise corporations published from 2015 to 2019 and their website pages by using the Leximancer text-mining software to map the underlying main research topics with the visual concepts range and manual content analysis. The results highlight the increasing commitment of cruise corporations to reduce the environmental impact by meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs) included in the UN 2030 Agenda by investing in digital technologies on-board ships. Using a double level of sustainability reporting analysis, this study, compared to previous studies, seeks to determine best practices on operational processes on-board ships regarding waste issues, including the digital technologies as an enabler to sustainability, especially SDGs. This study opens the way to scholars about waste processes and financial investment in technology issues, as well as the role played by the regulatory framework. In addition, this study highlights the insufficiency of the theory of legitimacy alone to identify best practices related to broader waste issues. Likewise, the practitioners find in this study a key roadmap about the need to involve crew and cruisers in the waste digital process thanks sharing of programs to define the waste practices. Practitioners also find the address to the factors that will make them aware of the current weakness of nonfinancial disclosure in sustainability reporting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first time an empirical analysis conducted through sustainability reporting and other non-financial documents allows to identify 'best practices' adopted on-board cruise ships to meet sustainability goals in digital waste management. Moreover, the use of two levels of analysis, by Leximancer and manual content analysis about the text documents companies make available to stakeholders, allows for identifying the high-level concepts and key ideas without bias, well as being able to define the perimeter of good practices linked to the orientation of cruise corporations toward new technologies.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr) Disclosure; Cruise Corporations; Cruise Waste Practices; Legitimacy Theory; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Data Mining; Environmental Impact; Environmental Technology; Planning; Ships; Social Aspects; Waste Management; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure; Cruise Corporation; Cruise Waste Practice; Digital Technologies; Legitimacy Theories; Marine Vehicles; Stakeholder; Sustainability Reporting; Sustainable Development Goal; Sustainable Development","Data mining; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Planning; Ships; Social aspects; Waste management; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility disclosure; Cruise corporation; Cruise waste practice; Digital technologies; Legitimacy theories; Marine vehicles; Stakeholder; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable development","Funding text 1: Manuscript received 21 April 2022; revised 26 June 2022; accepted 2 August 2022.

Among various strategies for achieving SDGs, CSR has become a dominant practice by which managers eliminate corporate social impact and develop social responsibility and commitment. To improve the integration of CSR into organizational practices, companies began to explore various available options. Academic studies began to analyze drivers, barriers, and best practices in CSR. More recent organizational structures are being transformed with the advent of new industry 4.0 technologies. There is good evidence that these technological integrations can improve the organization's overall performance. This article attempts to consider such technologies in CSR management. Industry 4.0 technologies, integrated with CSR and their practices, have been analyzed as 'CSR 4.0 practices.' A theoretical framework has been proposed that links the practice-based view with the theory of social good. Further, the theory has been validated through a case study in which 23 CSR 4.0 practices that enhance better integration of digitization with the company's conventional CSR were collected from the literature and validated with experts for social good. These practices were further analyzed with DEMATEL, a multicriterion decision-making tool using case decision-makers' responses. Case study methods have been adapted to this article, where the textile sector from one of the developing contexts, India, has been considered. Among 23 CSR 4.0 practices, 'data ownership policy and rights' (P22) has been identified as the most influential CSR 4.0 practice, while 'digital technology recycling' (P19) ranks as the least influential. The resulting influential practices have been correlated with CSR 4.0 performances and, further, those performances are connected with their respective SDGs. This article warrants several scientific and societal contributions to CSR; this article is groundbreaking and contributes to theory building in CSR through the identification and analysis of CSR 4.0 practices. Further expansion of this article may be more fruitful due to the digitized changes in organizational culture.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr) 4.0; Dematel; Industry 4.0; Practice-based View (pbv); Social Good Theory; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Economic And Social Effects; Industry 4.0; Integration; Planning; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility 4.0; Decisions Makings; Dematel; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Good Theories; Industrial Revolutions; Information Age; Practice-based View; Social Good Theory; Social Networking (online); Stakeholder; Sustainable Development Goal; Decision Making","Economic and social effects; Industry 4.0; Integration; Planning; Sustainable development; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility 4.0; Decisions makings; DEMATEL; Fourth industrial revolution; Good theories; Industrial revolutions; Information age; Practice-based view; Social good theory; Social networking (online); Stakeholder; Sustainable development goal; Decision making","","Adamik, Anna, Pathologies and paradoxes of co-creation: A contribution to the discussion about corporate social responsibility in building a competitive advantage in the age of Industry 4.0, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 18, (2019); Ahel, Oliver, Opportunities and Challenges of Digitalization to Improve Access to Education for Sustainable Development in Higher Education, World Sustainability Series, pp. 341-356, (2020); Arun, K., Convergence of csr and industry 4.0. recent trends in indian public sector enterprises, August, (2020); undefined, (2017); Badri, Adel, Occupational health and safety in the industry 4.0 era: A cause for major concern?, Safety Science, 109, pp. 403-411, (2018); Barbeito-Caamaño, Adriana M., Using big data to evaluate corporate social responsibility and sustainable development practices, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2831-2848, (2020); Battisti, Sandro, Digital Social Entrepreneurs as Bridges in Public–Private Partnerships, Journal of Social Entrepreneurship, 10, 2, pp. 135-158, (2019); Breuer, Johannes, The practical and ethical challenges in acquiring and sharing digital trace data: Negotiating public-private partnerships, New Media and Society, 22, 11, pp. 2058-2080, (2020); Bromiley, Philip, Towards a practice-based view of strategy, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 8, pp. 1249-1256, (2014); Bromiley, Philip, Missing the point of the practice-based view, Strategic Organization, 14, 3, pp. 260-269, (2016)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15580040; 00189391","","IEEMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129581265"

Our research synthesizes contributions from CDR literature on the corporate governance mission, measures, and frameworks to determine the status quo.

In this study, we consider the responsiveness of one Big Tech company to criticisms about their handling of matters relating to privacy. Using a grounded theory approach, we analyze a longitudinal data set (2013-2022) of earnings conference calls between Meta and market stakeholders. Our discussion explores the tensions between corporate narratives and the enactment of digital responsibility. We argue that Big Tech does respond, but such responsiveness generates new challenges. Compared to notions of responsiveness in prior literature, our findings show how responsibilities are becoming revised and repositioned in ways that reinforce the dominance of Big Tech. While Meta claims that their 'technical solution' successfully counters past criticism about privacy transgressions, we conclude by drawing attention to the notion of confidentiality washing and its implications for theory and practice.","Big Tech; Digital Responsibility; Ethics; Narrative Analysis; Qualitative; Information Use; Big Tech; Corporates; Data Set; Digital Responsibility; Grounded Theory Approach; Longitudinal Data; Narrative Analysis; Qualitative; Technical Solutions; Theory And Practice; Information Systems","Information use; Big tech; Corporates; Data set; Digital responsibility; Grounded theory approach; Longitudinal data; Narrative analysis; Qualitative; Technical solutions; Theory and practice; Information systems","","Bloomfield, Robert J., Discussion of ""Annual report readability, current earnings, and earnings persistence, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 45, 2-3, pp. 248-252, (2008); Information Technology and Changes in Organizational Work, (1996); Acts of Meaning, (1990); Constructing Grounded Theory A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis, (2006); Coeckelbergh, Mark, Artificial Intelligence, Responsibility Attribution, and a Relational Justification of Explainability, Science and Engineering Ethics, 26, 4, pp. 2051-2068, (2020); A Narrative Approach to Organization Studies, (1998); Firewall Times, (2023); Jasanoff, Sheila S., Technologies of humility: Citizen participation in governing science, Minerva, 41, 3, pp. 223-244, (2003); Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings, (2024); Owen, R.

The study was conducted using Stata 17.0 software based on data (5709 observations) on 558 A-share listed manufacturing companies of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock for 2012-2021 (excluding financial and insurance companies, ST and ST* companies, as well as companies with incomplete data). The independent variable used in the modelling process is the CSR rating report of the Hexun website, indicators of which are reconstructed by dividing them into strategic CSR (shareholder responsibility, employee responsibility, customer responsibility) and altruistic CSR (environmental responsibility and social contribution). The dependent variable is 2 CFP indicators: return on equity (ROE) and TOBIN's Q. The DT index is used as a moderating variable, for the calculation of which the texts of companies' annual reports were segmented using the Python programming language and standardised data on the frequency of keywords in 4 dimensions: digital technology application, Internet business model, intelligent manufacturing and contemporary information system; the weights for each dimension index was determined using the entropy approach. The control variables are corporate assets (Size), financial leverage level (Lev), current ratio (Cur), firm growth (Gro), shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder (First) and technological innovation (RD) of companies. The study also considered the year and industry factors. To study the moderating effect of DT on the relationship between CSR and CFP indicators of companies in different situations, the grouping variables chosen were the ownership type (state-owned and non-state-owned companies), the enterprise lifecycle (cash flow portfolio method was used to identify its stages) and the degree of market competition (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index). The modelling is based on a fixed-effects regression model. The study found that both CSR and DT have a positive impact on CFP, and that DT moderates the relationship between CSR and CFP, indicating that integrating digital technologies with sustainable development strategies can enhance financial benefits. The study also highlights the importance of different dimensions of corporate social responsibility. A high level of digital transformation strengthens the promotion effect of strategic social responsibility on current and future financial success of companies. Meanwhile, the promotion effect of altruistic social responsibility on current financial performance is significant. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the positive moderating effect of digital transformation on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance mainly applies to private firms, firms in the mature stage, and firms with low market competition. The article offers practical advice for businesses seeking to use digital transformation to maximise economic and social value.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Enterprise Lifecycle; Financial Performance; Market Competition; Ownership Type","","This research was funded by Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China, grant number ZR2022MG012, and Shandong Provincial Social Science Planning Program, China, grant number 22CGLJ09.","Abudaqa, Anas M., Does innovation moderate the relationship between digital facilitators, digital transformation strategies and overall performance of SMEs of UAE?, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Venturing, 14, 3, pp. 330-350, (2022); East China Economic Management, (2022); Borland, Helen, Building Theory at the Intersection of Ecological Sustainability and Strategic Management, Journal of Business Ethics, 135, 2, pp. 293-307, (2016); Branco, Manuel Castelo, Corporate social responsibility and resource-based perspectives, Journal of Business Ethics, 69, 2, pp. 111-132, (2006); Chen, Pengyu, Corporate social responsibility, financing constraints, and corporate carbon intensity: new evidence from listed Chinese companies, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 14, pp. 40107-40115, (2023); Guping, Cheng, The relationship between csr communication on social media, purchase intention, and e-wom in the banking sector of an emerging economy, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16, 4, pp. 1025-1041, (2021); Chuang, Shunpin, The Effect of Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility on Environmental Performance and Business Competitiveness: The Mediation of Green Information Technology Capital, Journal of Business Ethics, 150, 4, pp. 991-1009, (2018); Čorejová, Tatiana, Assessing the potential for digital transformation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 19, (2021); Dickinson, Victoria, Cash flow patterns as a proxy for firm life cycle, Accounting Review, 86, 6, pp. 1969-1994, (2011); Fernández-Rovira, Cristina, The digital transformation of business.

Data were collected from 201 respondents in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi, and Surabaya between March and May 2024. Using a quantitative approach and PLS-SEM for analysis, the findings reveal that perceived value and CSR have significant positive effects on purchase decisions, indicating that consumers prioritize product quality and ethical brand practices when making purchases. Conversely, social media marketing and sales promotion showed positive but non-significant effects, suggesting that while they contribute to brand awareness, they do not strongly drive purchase decisions in this context. These findings provide valuable insights for fashion brands, emphasizing the need to focus on delivering high perceived value and maintaining strong CSR practices to influence consumer purchase behavior effectively.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Perceived Value; Purchase Decision; Sales Promotion; Social Media Marketing; Consumer Expectations; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Marketing; Fashion Industry; Marketing Channels; On-line Fashion; Perceived Value; Purchase Decision; Sales Promotions; Social Media Marketings; Sales","Consumer expectations; Corporate social responsibility; Digital marketing; Fashion industry; Marketing channels; On-line fashion; Perceived value; Purchase decision; Sales promotions; Social media marketings; Sales","","Central European Management Journal, (2022); Influence of Corporate Social Responsibility Social Media Marketing Sales Promotion and Perceived Value on Consumer Purchase Decision on the Tokopedia Marketplace, (2023); International Journal of Review Management Business and Entrepreneurship, (2021); Advanced International Journal of Business Entrepreneurship and Smes, (2021); Hanaysha, Jalal Rajeh, An examination of the factors affecting consumer’s purchase decision in the Malaysian retail market, PSU Research Review, 2, 1, pp. 7-23, (2018); Haudi, The effects of social media marketing, store environment, sales promotion and perceived value on consumer purchase decisions in small market, International Journal of Data and Network Science, 6, 1, pp. 67-72, (2022); International Journal of Social Service and Research, (2023); Advanced International Journal of Banking Accounting and Finance, (2021); Journal of Business and Management Review, (2021); European Journal of Business and Management Research, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798331533243","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004413022"

This study investigates the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on employee performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Vietnamese Logistics industry, with organizational commitment (OC) and person-organization fit (P-O Fit) as mediating factors. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with data from 557 employees, the study finds that CSR positively influences employee performance both directly and indirectly through OC and P-O Fit. The results contribute to the growing literature on CSR in emerging markets and provide practical insights for Logistics SMEs seeking to enhance employee performance through CSR initiatives.

Study 1 focuses on the German automotive industry and adopts a qualitative inductive approach based on interviews with IT practitioners to ascertain the key aspects of digitalisation impacting the industry and to chart the emergence of a new model for the management of IT. Study 2 then reviews the deployment of digital technologies in other industry sectors via questionnaire responses from senior IT professionals in eight organisations. The results suggest that the transfer of IT roles and responsibilities to business functions, evident in the German automotive industry, is being replicated in other organisations in which digital technologies are now embedded in an organisation’s products or services.

The goal of this paper is to study the experience and prospects of the humanisation of AI through the improvement of the practice of corporate social responsibility in Russia. By the example of the experience of Russian regions in 2021, we use econometric modelling to prove that the digital regional economy has a large potential in the sphere of humanisation of AI. The potential for the humanisation of AI in the digital economy of Russian regions is determined by responsible innovations, responsible production and logistics, as well as responsible marketing and sales, which contribute to the implementation of SDGs 9–12. The theoretical significance of the paper lies in its presenting smart region as a socio-economic environment for the humanisation of AI. The scientific novelty of the paper lies in its offering a new—meso-level—view of the humanisation of AI. The advantages of the new view include, first, consideration of socio-economic conditions for the humanisation of AI in a region; second, the most precise identification and correct measuring of the consequences of humanisation of AI for the quality of life in a region. The practical significance of the research results consists in the fact that the new proposed approach to the humanisation of AI, which implies public administration of this process at the level of a region, allows accelerating the considered process.","","","","Abdulqader, Raghad Abdulhadi, Modelling mechanisms for measurable and detection based on artificial intelligence, IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence, 12, 4, pp. 2042-2047, (2023); Ahmad, Sayed Fayaz, Impact of artificial intelligence on human loss in decision making, laziness and safety in education, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 10, 1, (2023); Akbarighatar, Pouria, A sociotechnical perspective for responsible AI maturity models: Findings from a mixed-method literature review, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 3, 2, (2023); Akter, Shahriar, Transforming business using digital innovations: the application of AI, blockchain, cloud and data analytics, Annals of Operations Research, 308, 1-2, pp. 7-39, (2022); Antonelli, Cristiano, Technological congruence and Smart Specialisation: evidence from European regions, Spatial Economic Analysis, 18, 2, pp. 173-196, (2023); Budhwar, Pawan S., Human resource management in the age of generative artificial intelligence: Perspectives and research directions on ChatGPT, Human Resource Management Journal, 33, 3, pp. 606-659, (2023); Cheng, Lu, Socially responsible AI algorithms: Issues, purposes, and challenges, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 71, pp. 1137-1181, (2021); Chong, Leah M., Human confidence in artificial intelligence and in themselves: The evolution and impact of confidence on adoption of AI advice, Computers in Human Behavior, 127, (2022); Clarke, Roger A., Principles and business processes for responsible AI, Computer Law and Security Review, 35, 4, pp. 410-422, (2019); Main Directions for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the Sphere of Public Administration in the Region, (2023)","","Springer Nature","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179709244"

We argue that incidental governmentality offers a creative context to critically scrutinise the changing rationalities of government in the age of Big Tech and digital surveillance. Incidental governmentality exhibits the same pastoral character as biopolitics: as governmental power is realised through the provision of life affirming public goods and services including improved public health, financial security, and social connection. However, incidental governmentality is incidental to the extent that its governmental reasons are secondary to that of its corporate rationalities. This paper charts the historical origins of incidental forms governmentality and the value of applying this theoretical perspective to emerging governmental forms. Analysis outlines the nature and critical implications of incidental forms of governmentality and draws out its distinctions with corporate governmentality, corporate social responsibility, and algorithmic governmentality. This paper utilises the idea of incidental governmentality to make sense of the “governmental” interventions of Big-Tech companies such as Facebook and Google in response to COVID-19 in the UK. Through this case study analysis considers the processes that enabled the rapid mobilisation of Big Tech within public health initiatives and what this can tell us about the political and geographical implications of incidental governmentality.","Big Tech; Covid-19; Governmentality; Rationalities Of Government; Surveillance Capitalism","","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Within this context, the Social Life Cycle Assessment emerges as a valuable tool for assessing the socioeconomic impact assessment associated with the life cycle of industrial products. Despite the presence of a methodological framework with a structured process, the implementation of the Social Life Cycle Assessment within the industrial domain is hampered by the lack of precise indicators, context-specific databases, limited case studies, and the dynamic characteristics inherent in social data. This study conducts a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and examines methodologies, databases, and software, focusing specifically on its applicability in the design and development of industrial products. The main objective is to evaluate the current research effort, identify available technical and digital resources for implementation in industrial companies, and outline key areas of work and specific challenges related to the social dimension of life cycle assessment. The results emphasize the priority of improving indicator frameworks within specific impact categories and developing novel metrics to mitigate uncertainty in decision-making processes. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of transitioning to standardized application procedures within industrial product sectors, thus ensuring methodological consistency and improving the reliability of assessments.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Industrial Products; Life Cycle Assessment; Social Development Indicators; Social Life Cycle Assessment; Socioeconomic Impact","","This work was supported by the VII-PPITUS of the Universidad de Sevilla , grant number: 2022/00000329 .

This study focused on the relationship between digital transformation (DT) and corporate environmental responsibility based on sample data of A-share listed companies during 2010–2018, considering the typical data of corporate DT in recent years. DT can effectively incentivize firms, particularly heavy polluters, mature firms, and bear markets, to fulfill their environmental responsibilities, and the findings hold after the robustness tests. DT can also ultimately enhance the level of corporate environmental responsibility through micro-paths such as improved internal disclosure and enhanced attention from external investors. Simultaneously, local governments have significantly strengthened the incentive effect of DT on enterprises’ fulfillment of environmental responsibility by actively practicing green development and increasing environmental protection investments. These results provide an important theoretical and practical basis for promoting environmental pollution management and strengthening the policy support for DT.","Digital Transformation; Environmental Liability; Environmental Pollution; Government Action","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71934001 ], I nnovation and Development of Social Sciences Funds of Anhui Province [grant number 2021CX040 ], Philosophy and Social Science Funds of Anhui Provincial Department of Education [grant number 2023AH040034 ; 2022AH030028 ], Housing and Urban Rural Construction Science and Technology Plan Project of Anhui Province [grant number 2023-RK020 ], and Research Startup Fund of Anhui Jianzhu University [grant number 2022QDZ17 ].; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71934001], Innovation and Development of Social Sciences Funds of Anhui Province [grant number 2021CX040], Philosophy and Social Science Funds of Anhui Provincial Department of Education [grant number 2023AH040034; 2022AH030028], Housing and Urban Rural Construction Science and Technology Plan Project of Anhui Province [grant number2023-RK020], and Research Startup Fund of Anhui Jianzhu University [grant number 2022QDZ17].","International Journal of Business Studies, (2003); Bai, Yu, The impacts of government R&D subsidies on green innovation: Evidence from Chinese energy-intensive firms, Journal of Cleaner Production, 233, pp. 819-829, (2019); Bharadwaj, Anandhi S., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Chen, Ziyu, What is driving corporate social and environmental responsibility in China?

This paper analyses the theoretical framework for the impact of digital transformation on the total factor productivity of heavily polluting firms. Using a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share heavy polluters from 2010 to 2020, we explore how the digital transformation of heavy polluters affects the total factor productivity of firms. The study found that the digital transformation of heavily polluting companies can effectively improve total factor productivity, internally by increasing their level of green technology innovation and externally by increasing their willingness and capacity for corporate social responsibility. At the same time, digital transformation can improve total factor productivity by reducing cost stickiness, revealing the ""black box"" in which digital transformation affects the total factor productivity of an enterprise. It was further found that the digital transformation of companies with high levels of environmental investment, large enterprises, those in non-manufacturing industries, and heavy polluters of a state-owned nature had a more significant impact on total factor productivity. The findings of the study provide empirical evidence for the digital transformation of heavily polluting companies to improve productivity and the green transformation of the economy for companies under the low carbon goal.","","","This research was funded by Key scientific research project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education (No.18JZ052); Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Foundation (2022D161);Research on major theoretical and practical problems of philosophy and Social Sciences in Shaanxi Province general project later funded project ""Research on cultivation mechanism and Countermeasures of data factor market in Shaanxi Province""; Research project of high quality development special research project of Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress Financial and Eco-nomic Committee (2022HZ1500); Shaanxi Province Philosophy and Social Sciences Major Theoretical and Practical Problems Re-search General Project Later Funding Project (SX-318); Communications Soft Science Project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (2021-R-44); General project of Xi'an soft science research (21RKYJ0019); General Project of Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education (20YJC630086); Key Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (20JT058); Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications Postgraduate Innovation Fund Project (CXJJYW2021018).","undefined; Finance Trade Economics, (2021); Economic Research Journal, (2020); Manag World, (2021); Journal of Shaanxi Normal University Philosophy and Social Sciences Edition, (2022); Manag World, (2020); Wen, Huwei, Digitalization, competition strategy and corporate innovation: Evidence from Chinese manufacturing listed companies, International Review of Financial Analysis, 82, (2022); J Ind Technol Econ, (2022); Ciampi, Francesco, Exploring the impact of big data analytics capabilities on business model innovation: The mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation, Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 1-13, (2021); Chinese Journal of Management, (2021)","","Nature Research","20452322","","","37076699","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152977865"

Design/methodology/approach: Given the novelty of this field, a qualitative exploratory research study was carried out. For this research, 28 Indian CSR experts on online CSR reviews were interviewed with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire for data collection. Thematic and relational content analysis was applied for data analysis. The data was analysed based upon the theoretical anchors of micro foundations approach, organizational egoism (reputational and economic) concept and organizational logic (instrumental and integrative) literature and stakeholder salience. Findings: The study analysis indicated that online CSR reviews that organizations received on various social networking sites and internet-based platforms from different individual and institutional stakeholders were complaints, appreciations, observations and recommendations in nature. Online CSR reviews appreciated more of integrative organizational logic than instrumental organizational logic. CSR reviews present on online platforms valued organizational reputational egoism more than organizational economic egoism. The salience of stakeholders was getting redefines in Web 2.0 based online CSR reviews. Finally, micro foundations approach was becoming a more potent perspective in the CSR narrative. Research limitations/implications: This research study was anchored in the micro foundations approach of CSR (Hafenbrädl and Waeger, 2017). This study ascertained those individuals did matter in organizational CSR narrative (Maak et al., 2016). Furthermore, how firms were evaluated through online reviews based upon organizational egoism (reputational and economic) (Casali, 2011; Casali and Day, 2015) and organizational logic (instrumental and integrative) (Seele and Lock, 2015; Liu, 2013; Gao and Bansal, 2013; Bansal and Song, 2017) was studied. Finally, in the world of online reviews, the notion of salient stakeholders (Mitchell et al., 2011; Magness, 2008) was getting redefined, and this aspect was also covered in this research study. Practical implications: Firms have been engaging in CSR initiatives towards provision of social benefits and community engagement. Regarding firm CSR initiatives, CSR managers traditionally used to receive feedback from the stakeholders based upon written and special surveys conducted post or during the late stages of CSR engagement. The advent and ubiquitous presence of digital mobile devices and Web 2.0-enabled internet connections altered the way firms received feedback. This was because increasingly online reviews were received from stakeholders on firm CSR web pages, social networking sites and other online spaces. Many of the online CSR reviews were regarding the compliments and achievements that the CSR initiatives had achieved. However, a significant portion of online CSR reviews were regarding the complaints regarding the CSR initiatives. Online CSR reviews received from an array of stakeholders are inputs for firm managers. Online CSR reviews are thus an asset for an organization. Managers need to develop capabilities towards applying this asset for the expressed purposed. These online CSR reviews could be used as inputs to draw new CSR initiatives, redefine extant CSR initiatives. Furthermore, these online CSR reviews could be used as inputs to alter the organizational resources, capabilities, competencies and process regarding CSR initiatives. Originality/value: This was one of the first studies that integrated the theoretical aspects of salient stakeholders, organizational logic, organizational egoism through the lens of micro foundations approach in the context of organizational CSR initiatives. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this was indeed a novel contribution, as the same was explored and explicated based upon online CSR reviews on internet-based platforms.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr) Initiatives; Micro Foundations Approach; Online Reviews; Organizational Egoism; Organizational Logic; Stakeholder Salience; Web 2.0-enabled Internet Platforms","","","International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2019); Ahmad, Naveed, Csr communication through social media: A litmus test for banking consumers’ loyalty, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-16, (2021); Ali, Imran, Using social media for CSR communication and engaging stakeholders, Developments in Corporate Governance and Responsibility, 7, pp. 165-185, (2015); Indian Scholar, (2017); Atkins, Madeleine J., Practitioner as researcher: Some techniques for analysing semi-structured data in small-scale research, British Journal of Educational Studies, 32, 3, pp. 251-261, (1984); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Similar but not the same: Differentiating corporate sustainability from corporate responsibility, Academy of Management Annals, 11, 1, pp. 105-149, (2017); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Managing responsibly in tough economic times: Strategic and tactical CSR during the 2008-2009 global recession, Long Range Planning, 48, 2, pp. 69-79, (2015); Barriball, K.

The integration of these elements empowers manufacturers to revolutionize their clothing design and production methods, leading to the delivery of unparalleled fit, comfort, and personalization for a wide range of body shapes and sizes. DHM, known for its precision in representing human bodies virtually and integrating anthropometric data, including ergonomic measurements, enhances the shopping experience by providing valuable insights. Consumers gain access to the knowledge necessary for making tailored clothing choices, thereby enhancing the personalization and satisfaction of their shopping experience. The incorporation of e-library resources takes the garment design approach to a data-driven and customer-centric level. Manufacturers can draw upon a wealth of information regarding body-size diversity, fashion trends, and customer preferences, all sourced from e-libraries. This knowledge supports the creation of a diverse range of sizes and styles, promoting inclusivity and relevance. Beyond improving garment fit, this comprehensive integration streamlines design and production processes by reducing the reliance on physical prototypes. This not only enhances efficiency but also contributes to environmental responsibility, fostering a more sustainable and eco-friendly future for the garment industry and embracing the future of fashion, where technology and data converge to create clothing that authentically fits, resonates with consumers, and aligns with the principles of sustainability.

Increased attention is being paid to the corporate human rights due diligence (HRDD) responsibilities applicable to online platforms countering illegal online content, such as hate speech. At the European Union (EU) level, cross-sector initiatives regulate the rights of marginalised groups and establish HRDD responsibilities for online platforms to expeditiously identify, prevent, mitigate, remedy and remove online hate speech. These initiatives include the Digital Services Act, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the proposed Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act and the Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. Nevertheless, the HRDD framework applicable to online hate speech has focused mostly on the platforms’ responsibilities throughout the course of their operations - guidance regarding HRDD requirements concerning the regulation of hate speech in the platforms’ Terms of Service (ToS) is missing. This paper employs a conceptualisation of criminal hate speech as explained in the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation CM/Rec(2022)16, Paragraph 11, to develop specific HRDD responsibilities. We argue that online platforms should, as part of emerging preventive HRDD responsibilities within Europe, respect the rights of historically oppressed communities by aligning their ToS with the conceptualisation of criminal hate speech in European human rights standards.","Content Moderation; Corporate Responsibility For Human Rights; Criminal Hate Speech; Historical Marginalisation; Intersectionality; Online Platforms; Information Services; Social Aspects; Content Moderation; Corporate Responsibility; Corporate Responsibility For Human Right; Criminal Hate Speech; Due Diligence; Historical Marginalization; Human Rights; Intersectionality; Marginalization; Online Platforms; Crime","Information services; Social aspects; Content moderation; Corporate responsibility; Corporate responsibility for human right; Criminal hate speech; Due diligence; Historical marginalization; Human rights; Intersectionality; Marginalization; Online platforms; Crime","This project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 861047 and from the Dutch Sectorplan for Social Sciences and Humanities.

ESG would receive more attention from the industry and academia in a global environment full of uncertainties. Companies benefit from the sharing of ESG data by improving their brand image, which attracts funding, lowers financing costs, and increases valuation. Purpose: To explore how ESG drives corporate financial performance. Also, the research examines the interrelation of ESG presentation and corporate presentation. Design: /methodology/approach: Over an interval of 10 years (2011–2020) using a sample of 3332 listed organizations worldwide. The theory of the research is on the basis of stakeholder and transmitting signal theory and multiple regression and categorized regression were applied with STATA 16.0 software. Results: The study utilizes a large dataset of 24,076 valid observations, providing robust statistical power for the analysis. The study findings proved that ESG performance is positively interrelated with corporate performance (p < 0.01). According to the findings of the study, at 1% of the level related to significance (p < 0.01), the regression coefficient for ESG is considerably positive. Thus, the influence of ESG rating on corporate performance is significant for large-scale companies and insignificant for small-scale companies. The results demonstrate that the positive impact of ESG rating on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in the high risk case than in the low risk case (p < 0.01). The results highlight the importance of ESG performance in today's world. Overall, the study gives precious perception about the interrelation between ESG and corporate financial performance (CFP). Policy implications: The researchers believe that the results of this study are beneficial to companies and governments in the development of environmentally conscious industries since they demonstrate corporate success through ESG. More realistically, the ESG can boost corporate firm performance by enabling businesses to maintain sustainability, establish a solid reputation, win the trust of stakeholders, and contribute to solving national sustainable development issues. Additionally, the researchers believe that the results of this study can boost management effectiveness, which in turn can help firms succeed. Originality/value: In the context of environmentally sensitive industries, this study findings provide empirical insights to the association between the corporate firms success and ESG performance. In addition, the findings provide insights to the business organizations development and the significance of ESG integration in the business organizations.","Corporate Financial Performance; Corporate Firm Success; Environmentally Sensitive Industries; Esg; Esg Performance; Carbon; Carbon; Image Enhancement; Investments; Large Dataset; Public Policy; Regression Analysis; Sustainable Development; Business Organizations; Corporate Financial Performance; Corporate Firm Success; Corporate Performance; Corporates; Environmental, Social, And Governance; Environmental, Social, And Governance Performance; Environmentally Sensitive; Environmentally Sensitive Industry; Performance; Digital Storage; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Strategy; Industrial Investment; Industrial Performance; Industrial Policy; Multiple Regression; Sustainable Development; Article; Government; Human; Organization; Perception; Software; Trust; Commercial Phenomena; Industry; Investment; Carbon; Carbon; Commerce; Government; Industry","Image enhancement; Investments; Large dataset; Public policy; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Business organizations; Corporate financial performance; Corporate firm success; Corporate performance; Corporates; Environmental, social, and governance; Environmental, social, and governance performance; Environmentally sensitive; Environmentally sensitive industry; Performance; Digital storage; business; corporate social responsibility; corporate strategy; industrial investment; industrial performance; industrial policy; multiple regression; sustainable development; article; government; human; organization; perception; software; trust; commercial phenomena; industry; investment; carbon; Carbon; Commerce; Government; Industry","","Aboud, Ahmed, The impact of social, environmental and corporate governance disclosures on firm value: Evidence from Egypt, Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies, 8, 4, pp. 442-458, (2018); Ahmad, Nisar, Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); Alsayegh, Maha Faisal, Corporate economic, environmental, and social sustainability performance transformation through ESG disclosure, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Bae, Kee Hong, Does CSR matter in times of crisis?

Consumers acutely perceive this power inequality and platforms’ digital power abuse. Meanwhile, platforms that practice algorithmic price discrimination are generally in a fiercely competitive oligopolistic market and are concerned about consumer loyalty. This study investigates the internal mechanism through which algorithmic price discrimination affects consumer loyalty. Based on consumer ethical perception theory, we develop a model of algorithmic price discrimination's influence on consumer loyalty and examined the moderating effect of consumer types. Analyzing 597 consumer responses, findings suggest price discrimination negatively influences perceived platform ethics and corporate social responsibility, thus reducing loyalty. This effect is more pronounced for consumers with high price sensitivity and initial trust. This study sheds light on algorithmic price discrimination's influence from a novel digital power-abuse perspective, reveals the underlying mechanisms, and provides specific suggestions for platform management.","Algorithmic Price Discrimination; Consumer Loyalty; Consumers’ Ethical Perceptions; Consumers’ Perceived Csr; Digital Power Abuse","","We thank the constructive comments and suggestions from editors and reviewers.

Despite available new technologies, increasing societal, environmental pressure, and data complexity, the branch lacks a will to innovate and qualified personnel. The study identifies the potential of innovation and the pillars of sustainability to define ways to responsibly use data-driven, smart technologies in smart cities throughout their holistic life cycles. The mix of expert interview surveys and structured literature analysis is the basis to examine the status quo and innovative approaches. It enables to critically investigate limitations and human, societal and environmental impacts. This study’s findings offer orientation in navigating innovation for resilient, agile ecosystems with the dynamic ability to adapt to changing environment and to grow with the change and achieving the sustainable development goals toward preservation and upgrade of buildings instead of new construction. The key challenge for sustainable technical innovation is to exploit human and societal potential. The study allocates the lack of research in this field and inadequate education as most significant limitations and critically evaluates that a disruptive culture of thinking may enable the sustainable design of smart cities. This study is unique as it develops a comprehensive, transparent Corporate Digital Responsibility Policy Framework and provides orientation to assume ethical, societal, environmental responsibility as part of creating resilient, agile environments.","Ai; Bim; Cdr; Construction; Digital Twins; Digitization; Smart Cities","","","Abdirad, Hamid, Artificial intelligence for BIM content management and delivery: Case study of association rule mining for construction detailing, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 50, (2021); Demir Altıntaş, Yelin, Loose coupling of GIS and BIM data models for automated compliance checking against zoning codes, Automation in Construction, 128, (2021); Ägerfalk, Pär J.J., Artificial Intelligence in Information Systems: State of the Art and Research Roadmap, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 50, 1, pp. 420-438, (2022); Allam, Zaheer, The Metaverse as a Virtual Form of Smart Cities: Opportunities and Challenges for Environmental, Economic, and Social Sustainability in Urban Futures, Smart Cities, 5, 3, pp. 771-801, (2022); Amor, Robert W., The promise of automated compliance checking, Developments in the Built Environment, 5, (2021); Arangiaro, Valentina, Blockchain for circular economy in the furniture sector: The case of cubo design S.r.l., pp. 238-275, (2022); Araújo, Caroline Silva, DIGITAL TWINS AND LEAN CONSTRUCTION: CHALLENGES FOR FUTURE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, pp. 235-246, (2022); Bednárová, Michaela, Corporate digital responsibility: bibliometric landscape – chronological literature review, International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 23, (2023); Belle, Vaishak, Knowledge representation and acquisition for ethical AI: challenges and opportunities, Ethics and Information Technology, 25, 1, (2023); Bibri, Simon Elias, Data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: An evidence synthesis approach to a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review, Sustainable Futures, 3, (2021)","","Bon View Publishing Pte Ltd","28110854","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006583661"

This article empirically testifies the impact path of corporate digital transformation level on green technology innovation ability, from the perspective of green technology innovation, based on the A-shares of 2660 manufacturing companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen between 2015 and 2020 by using a fixed-effect zero-inflation negative binomial regression model. Digital transformation can enhance enterprises' green technology innovation capability, according to the results, and several robustness tests have confirmed this finding. By improving corporate social responsibility, corporate digital transformation enhances green technology innovation capability. When it comes to the heterogeneity of corporate digital transformation's promotion of green technology innovation, compared to large enterprises, SMEs have an obvious advantage. Non-heavy polluting industries are significantly higher than heavy polluting firms while heavy polluting firms are not able to innovate using green technologies as a result of enterprise digital transformation.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Green Technology Innovation; Economic And Social Effects; Engineering Research; Industrial Economics; Social Aspects; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporates; Digital Transformation; Economic Structure; Green Technology; Green Technology Innovation; High Quality; Innovation Capability; National Economy; Technology Innovation; Regression Analysis","Economic and social effects; Engineering research; Industrial economics; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibility; Corporates; Digital transformation; Economic structure; Green technology; Green technology innovation; High quality; Innovation capability; National economy; Technology innovation; Regression analysis","This work was supported by NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA [grant number 19BJY208 ].","Abbas, Jawad, Impact of knowledge management practices on green innovation and corporate sustainable development: A structural analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 611-620, (2019); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Ben Arfi, Wissal, External knowledge sources, green innovation and performance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 129, pp. 210-220, (2018); Chen, Yushan, The influence of green innovation performance on corporate advantage in Taiwan, Journal of Business Ethics, 67, 4, pp. 331-339, (2006); East China Econom Manag, (2022); Cohen, Lauren H., Misvaluing Innovation, Review of Financial Studies, 26, 3, pp. 635-666, (2013); Cohn, Jonathan B., Count (and count-like) data in finance, Journal of Financial Economics, 146, 2, pp. 529-551, (2022); Asia Pacific Econ, (2022); Etter, Michael Andreas, Sharing Economy, Sharing Responsibility?

The PMG estimation technique is employed to analyze the data. The findings reveal that higher expenditure on information and communication technology (ICT) is associated with increased investments in ESG, indicating the positive influence of digitalization on sustainability efforts. Conversely, higher energy expenditure has a negative effect on ESG investing, emphasizing the significance of energy efficiency in achieving ESG goals. Moreover, the study identifies total assets and stock price as significant factors driving ESG investments, highlighting the importance of financial capacity and market sentiment. However, concerns arise regarding the allocation of loans received, suggesting insufficient green financing for ESG initiatives. To promote ESG investing through digitalization and resource efficiency, practical policies such as incentivizing the deployment of green energy and implementing efficient emission taxation are recommended. These measures can foster sustainable practices in publicly listed companies.","Digital Transformation; Energy Expenditure; Esg Investing; G7 Economies; Resource Efficiency; Economics; Energy Efficiency; Sustainable Development; Taxation; Asset Prices; Digital Transformation; Energy Expenditure; Environmental, Social, And Governance Investing; Estimation Techniques; Financial Capacity; G7 Economy; Information And Communication Technologies; Resource Efficiencies; Stock Price; Investments; Corporate Social Responsibility; Energy Efficiency; G-7 Country; Information And Communication Technology; Investment; Resource Use","Economics; Energy efficiency; Sustainable development; Taxation; Asset prices; Digital transformation; Energy expenditure; Environmental, social, and governance investing; Estimation techniques; Financial capacity; G7 economy; Information and Communication Technologies; Resource efficiencies; Stock price; Investments; corporate social responsibility; energy efficiency; G-7 country; information and communication technology; investment; resource use","","Akana, John, Comparative eco-efficiency assessment of cybersecurity solutions, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 100, (2023); Chen, Yufeng, Digital transformation and firm cost stickiness: Evidence from China, Finance Research Letters, 52, (2023); Chen, Zewen, How do external and internal factors drive green innovation practices under the influence of big data analytics capability: Evidence from China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 404, (2023); Deng, Xiang, More sustainable, more productive: Evidence from ESG ratings and total factor productivity among listed Chinese firms, Finance Research Letters, 51, (2023); Dmuchowski, Piotr, Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) model; impacts and sustainable investment – Global trends and Poland's perspective, Journal of Environmental Management, 329, (2023); Han, Jingwei, How natural resources affect financial development development?

Here we draw on social responsibility, fintech and digital purchasing literatures, and institutional and stakeholder theories to explain variations in supplier payment times. A sample of 509 firms spanning 2018–2021 is used for panel regression analysis. Contrary to expectations, the COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to longer payment times or reduced compliance with payment terms, which we attribute to state-funded business supports and corporate decisions to accelerate payment to vulnerable suppliers. Institutional pressure in the form of payment codes was associated with shorter payment times and improved compliance during the pandemic. Supply chain finance (SCF) was associated with longer payment times during the pandemic while e-invoicing had no effect. Overall, institutional pressure seems to contribute to faster payment but stakeholder-centred fintech and digitalisation does not.","Covid-19 Pandemic; E-invoicing; Payment Codes; Responsible Purchasing; Supplier Payment Times; Supply Chain Finance (scf)","","In Table 7.1, the variable Signatory_treat#Pandemic shows an estimated mean difference of 18.3% quicker average payment times from signatory firms during the pandemic, which strongly supports the main results reported in Table 5.

Supply chain information transparency has thus attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. Meanwhile, as consumers pay more attention to corporate social responsibility (CSR), firms have made efforts to audit their suppliers to avoid CSR violations. This paper explores the strategic role of CSR auditing in supply chain information transparency. We examine how CSR auditing interacts with supply chain information transparency by considering a scenario where a firm strategically sells either a single product or a product line through an online retail platform. Our results show that when the product line strategy is uncertain, the firm’s audit commitment strengthens the platform’s incentive to voluntarily disclose information. Our results also show that when the length of the product line is unchangeable, the platform prefers to share the information even if the firm does not make audit commitments. Additionally, when the platform’s information sharing decision and the firm’s product line design are made simultaneously, the platform may choose to privately withhold the information if the product line extension cost is in the moderate range and the demand loss from CSR-concerned consumers is relatively minor.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Csr Auditing; Product Line Design; Supply Chain Information Transparency","","Acknowledgement: The work is financially supported by National Natural Science Funds of China (Nos. 71801206, 72171219, 71971203, 71921001), USTC Research Funds of the Double First-Class Initiative (YD2040002004), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2040000027), Special Research Assistant Support Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Four Batch Talent Programs of China.","Barth, Karina B., Requirements in performance measurement systems of construction projects from the lean production perspective, Frontiers of Engineering Management, 8, 3, pp. 442-455, (2021); Child Labour Scandal Hits Adidas, (2000); Caro, Felipe, Improving supplier compliance through joint and shared audits with collective penalty, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 20, 2, pp. 363-380, (2018); Chen, Jiayu, Supplier centrality and auditing priority in socially responsible supply chains, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 22, 6, pp. 1199-1214, (2020); Chen, Li, Sourcing under supplier responsibility risk: The effects of certification, audit, and contingency payment, Management Science, 63, 9, pp. 2795-2812, (2017); Chen, Zhixin, Refurbished products and supply chain incentives, Annals of Operations Research, 310, 1, pp. 27-47, (2022); Cho, Soohaeng, Combating child labor: Incentives and information disclosure in global supply chains, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 21, 3, pp. 692-711, (2019); Chung, Hwan, Store Brand Quality and Retailer's Product Line Design, Journal of Retailing, 93, 4, pp. 527-540, (2017); Dai, Xiaopei, A manufacturer’s responsible sourcing strategy: going organic or participating in fair trade?, Annals of Operations Research, 291, 1-2, pp. 195-218, (2020); Dong, Lingxiu, Selling a product line through a retailer when demand is stochastic: Analysis of price-only contracts, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, 21, 4, pp. 742-760, (2019)","","Springer","15729338; 02545330","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125541784"

The “environmental, social, and governance” (ESG) approach is important within the concept of SDGs and is the subject of increasing attention from scholars. Despite China’s significant contributions to the SDGs, it still faces numerous challenges in terms of environmental and governance development. With the ongoing development of digital technology, many Chinese enterprises aspire to harness the dividends of digital transformation in order to achieve SDGs. In this study, we aim to help companies understand how they can improve their ESG performance through digital transformation. We use a sample of A-share listed companies in China from 2011 to 2020 to construct a digital transformation index by profiling the frequency of digital-related words in companies’ annual reports using textual analysis. Furthermore, we empirically examine the direct effect of digital transformation on companies’ level of ESG disclosure and explore the mediating effect of dynamic capabilities on the impact of digital transformation on ESG performance. Empirical testing reveals that digital transformation indeed has a positive impact on enterprises’ ESG performance, and digital technology innovation can enhance ESG performance through dynamic capabilities such as green innovation, social responsibility, and operational management. The findings indicate that companies need to actively develop and promote digital technologies to obtain the benefits of digital transformation, with company executives including advanced technology in their decision-making and operational processes in an effort to promote innovation and management efficiency, thereby improving their ESG performance.","Ambidexterity Theory; Digital Transformation; Dynamic Capabilities; Environmental, Social, And Governance; Mechanism Analysis; Advanced Technology; Corporate Social Responsibility; Decision Making; Digitization; Innovation; Sustainable Development Goal; China","advanced technology; corporate social responsibility; decision making; digitization; innovation; Sustainable Development Goal; China","This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (19BGL150), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2020MG046), and Social Science Foundation of Jilin Province (2022J10).","Niu, Yuhao, Breaking barriers to innovation: The power of digital transformation, Finance Research Letters, 51, (2023); Cheng, Zhuo, Economic policy uncertainty and corporate digital transformation: evidence from China, Applied Economics, 55, 40, pp. 4625-4641, (2023); Jin, Xuejun, Government Attention, Market Competition and Firm Digital Transformation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 11, (2023); Jan, Ahmad Ali, Embedding sustainability into bank strategy: implications for sustainable development goals reporting, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 30, 3, pp. 229-243, (2023); Ogunmakinde, Olabode Emmanuel, Contributions of the circular economy to the UN sustainable development goals through sustainable construction, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 178, (2022); Clément, Alexandre, Improving ESG Scores with Sustainability Concepts, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 20, (2022); Fang, Mingyue, Can enterprise digitization improve ESG performance?, Economic Modelling, 118, (2023); Arvidsson, Susanne, Corporate ESG reporting quantity, quality and performance: Where to now for environmental policy and practice?, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 3, pp. 1091-1110, (2022); Li, Ning, The impact of digital supply chain capabilities on enterprise sustainable competitive performance: an ambidextrous view, Industrial Management and Data Systems, (2023); Su, Xin, Research on model design and operation mechanism of enterprise blockchain digital system, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172932290"

A responsible working environment facilitates effective internal communication, which is in line with the principles of the Bata Management System. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether setting top-down internal communication is in line with the sustainable principles of Tomas Bata in organizations in the Czech Republic. The article assesses workplace communication and relationships, including social sustainability and social responsibility, focusing on their added value for corporate practice in all areas of business. The study is based on quantitative research in organizations across sectors and qualitative research in agricultural organizations (questionnaire survey n1 = 183; focus group n3 = 5), using the tools of descriptive statistics, logistic regression and cluster analysis. The results have shown that combining methods of top-down communication is crucial for communicating information efficiently, stimulating employees and achieving the organization;s objectives and that Tomas Bata;s philosophy concerning communication setting can be implemented even more easily in the current digital age than it was in the past if organizations are interested. The research contributes to a better understanding of how the Bata Management System can be applied within each organization, how effective communication settings will help prevent conflicts that workers are engaged in, increase their stabilization, and facilitate the application of Bata's sustainable legacy in the international space. Research makes a significant contribution to advancing knowledge of effective communication from the perspective of Bata for the sustainability of agricultural organizations where the principles have not yet been explored. This is evidenced by the zero overlap with previously published articles despite the rapid progress of research and technology.","Article; Cluster Analysis; Czech Republic; Employee; Human; Human Experiment; Organization; Philosophy; Qualitative Research; Quantitative Analysis; Questionnaire; Social Responsibility; Worker; Workplace; Agriculture; Interpersonal Communication; Technology; Agriculture; Cluster Analysis; Communication; Humans; Philosophy; Technology","article; cluster analysis; Czech Republic; employee; human; human experiment; organization; philosophy; qualitative research; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; social responsibility; worker; workplace; agriculture; interpersonal communication; technology; Agriculture; Cluster Analysis; Communication; Humans; Philosophy; Technology","","Hitka, Miloš, Influence of selected macroeconomic indicators on employee motivation, E a M: Ekonomie a Management, 24, 3, pp. 4-22, (2021); Journal of Competitiveness, (2013); Vrabcová, Pavla, Strategic Trends of Organizations in the Context of New Perspectives of Sustainable Competitiveness, Journal of Competitiveness, 14, 2, pp. 174-193, (2022); Balaban, Milan, The Social Welfare System in Bata Company Towns (1920s-1950s): Between Transnational Vision and Local Settings, International Review of Social History, 68, 1, pp. 13-40, (2023); Planning Review, (1982); Men, Linjuan Rita, The internal communication role of the chief executive officer: Communication channels, style, and effectiveness, Public Relations Review, 41, 4, pp. 461-471, (2015); Tkalac Verčič, Ana, Managing internal communication: How the choice of channels affects internal communication satisfaction, Public Relations Review, 46, 3, (2020); Men, Linjuan Rita, Engaging Startup Employees via Charismatic Leadership Communication: The Importance of Communicating “Vision, Passion, and Care”, International Journal of Business Communication, 62, 3, pp. 562-582, (2025); Barendsen, Welmoed, Exploring team members’ perceptions of internal sustainability communication in sustainable project management, Project Leadership and Society, 2, (2021); Genç, Ruhet, The Importance of Communication in Sustainability & Sustainable Strategies, Procedia Manufacturing, 8, pp. 511-516, (2017)","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","37725622","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171901179"

Meanwhile, during the process of promoting the high-quality development of China’s economy, digital transformation plays a significant role in improving the total factor productivity of the manufacturing sector. We seek to find out whether urban environmental governance has an impact on micro-enterprises, and therefore, the study selects the data of A-share listed manufacturing companies from 2012 to 2020 to study the effect of digital transformation on the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry and how the effect of environmental governance affects the relationship between digital transformation and total factor productivity. The results unveil that digital transformation can significantly contribute to the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry. At the same time, digital transformation can promote the high-quality development of enterprises by promoting the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility. Additionally, it is shown that poor environmental governance will weaken the promoting effect of digital transformation on total factor productivity. Furthermore, in state-owned companies and non-heavy polluting industries, environmental governance has a more significant moderating influence on digital transformation and total factor productivity. This study enriches the literature on urban environmental governance and micro-enterprise development, and they support the notion that, from the standpoints of environmental protection and economic development, the level of environmental governance should be continuously optimized and the development of ecological civilization should be strengthened.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Environmental Governance; High-quality Development; Moderating Effect; Total Factor Productivity; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Economic Development; Environmental Protection; Industrial Enterprise; Manufacturing; Sustainable Development; Total Factor Productivity; China; Commercial Phenomena; Environmental Policy; Human; Manufacturing Industry; Commerce; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Humans; Manufacturing Industry","corporate social responsibility; digitization; economic development; environmental protection; industrial enterprise; manufacturing; sustainable development; total factor productivity; China; commercial phenomena; environmental policy; human; manufacturing industry; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Humans; Manufacturing Industry","This research was funded by the National Social Science Fund General Project of China (22BJL047), the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (2021SJZDA121), the National Social Science Fund Project of Jiangsu Province (21GLB001), and the China Institute of Manufacturing Development Open Project, “Research on industrial intelligence of furniture manufacturing industry.”","Aguinis, Herman, Improving Our Understanding of Moderation and Mediation in Strategic Management Research, Organizational Research Methods, 20, 4, pp. 665-685, (2017); Bardos, Katsiaryna Salavei, Corporate social responsibility, product market perception, and firm value, Journal of Corporate Finance, 62, (2020); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

This study explored the implications of circular economy practices for corporate performance using panel data from Chinese-listed firms between 2009 and 2019. To this end, the text analysis method was used to acquire the frequency of circular economy-related words to measure corporate circular economy practices. This study has yielded four main findings. First, circular economy practices can improve firm performance based on resource-based theory. Second, innovation and digital transformation strategies can amplify the positive impact, and resource use efficiency improvements are the principal means for circular economy practices. Third, there is firm heterogeneity in the influences of circular economy practices on corporate performance. Namely, the circular economy practices have a greater impact on state-owned enterprises, large enterprises, and heavily polluting enterprises. Fourth, only appropriate circular economy practices can positively impact firm performance. These findings suggest that circular economy practices are an effective model for sustainable corporate development. It is indeed important to understand the role of circular economy practices in emerging countries such as China, where rapid economic growth and urbanization have led to significant environmental challenges.","Circular Economy Practices; Corporate Performance; Corporate Strategy; Resource Use Efficiency; Economic And Social Effects; Natural Resources Management; Circular Economy; Circular Economy Practice; Corporate Performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Strategies; Firm Performance; Performance; Resource Use; Resource Use Efficiency; Use Efficiency; Efficiency","Economic and social effects; Natural resources management; Circular economy; Circular economy practice; Corporate performance; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate strategies; Firm Performance; Performance; Resource use; Resource use efficiency; Use efficiency; Efficiency","","Abou Taleb, Mona, Towards a circular economy for sustainable development: An application of full cost accounting to municipal waste recyclables, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Abu Bakar, Lily Julienti, Assessing the relationship between firm resources and product innovation performance: A resource-based view, Business Process Management Journal, 16, 3, pp. 420-435, (2010); Barrane, Fatima Zahara, Building trust in multi-stakeholder collaborations for new product development in the digital transformation era, Benchmarking, 28, 1, pp. 205-228, (2021); Opportunities for A Circular Economy in the Netherlands, (2013); Bocken, Nancy M.P., Product design and business model strategies for a circular economy, Journal of Industrial and Production Engineering, 33, 5, pp. 308-320, (2016); Bogers, Marcel, Strategic Management of Open Innovation: A Dynamic Capabilities Perspective, California Management Review, 62, 1, pp. 77-94, (2019); Buşu, Mihail, Adopting circular economy at the European Union level and its impact on economic growth, Social Sciences, 8, 5, (2019); Computer Communications, (2022); undefined, (2022); Chen, Pengyu, Digital transformation and corporate environmental performance: The moderating role of board characteristics, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1757-1767, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164224140"

The result shows that hiring green CEOs increases environmental protection investment (EPI), environmental compliance, and ESG ratings, significantly for firms in non-polluting sectors. Channel analysis shows that CEOs with green-related experience improve their environmental consciousness, which stimulates corporate environmental behavior. The positive effects of green CEOs are more pronounced in firms with high-quality digital transformation and better internal and external governance mechanisms. Our results survive a battery of robustness tests, such as endogeneity concerns, alternative measures, and heterogeneity analysis.

However, with the rise of the digital economy, it is still been determined whether digital transformation will become a driving force for firms to assume CER. Based on panel data of Chinese listed firms in polluting industries, this article empirically tests whether and how digital transformation affects CER. The results show that digital transformation significantly motivates firms to assume more CER, especially for state-owned and large-scale firms and those located in the western region and ordinary-level cities. The influence mechanism behind the relationship reveals that digital transformation improves financing ability and further encourages firms to assume CER. However, the effect is only short-term and has no significant influence on the long-term financing ability. Further research shows that regional differences in environmental governance pressure can strengthen the effect of digital transformation on CER. Our empirical findings provide policy implications for firms' digital transformation and sustainable development.","Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Financing Ability; Sustainable Development","","This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program), Grant/Award Number: 72133003 Funding information","Bárcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos, International trade and environmental corporate social responsibility, Energy Economics, 115, (2022); Beier, Grischa, Impact of Industry 4.0 on corporate environmental sustainability: Comparing practitioners’ perceptions from China, Brazil and Germany, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 31, pp. 287-300, (2022); Castro-González, Sandra, Influence of companies´ credibility and trust in corporate social responsibility aspects of consumer food products: The moderating intervention of consumer integrity, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 28, pp. 129-141, (2021); Chen, Pengyu, Digital transformation and corporate environmental performance: The moderating role of board characteristics, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 5, pp. 1757-1767, (2022); Chen, Wanyi, Can digital transformation improve the information environment of the capital market?

The study uses econometric panel data dependence techniques on a sample of 347 firm-year observations related to Italian non-financial listed companies for the period 2017–2019. The results highlight that independent directors, particularly those appointed by minority shareholders, influence positively CSR disclosure. Additionally, this relationship is strengthened by stakeholder e-engagement created by social media (SM), since higher is the companies visibility on Facebook, Linked In, and Twitter, and hence the institutional pressure felt by its independent directors, greater is the CSRDisc. This article suggests a new metric to evaluate stakeholder engagement by SM and a new index to measure CSRDisc based on both Directive 95/2014 and Global Reporting Initiative standard.

At the micro-level, construction organizations need an in-depth understanding of blockchain risks to take proactive strategies for being on the safe side. This study seeks to answer “What are the risks associated with blockchain technology from the firm-level perspective? And how can this disruptive technology overshadow the business objectives and impact organizational criteria?” Design/methodology/approach: The current research proposes a novel model for risk assessment based on the trapezoidal fuzzy ordinal priority approach (OPA-F) in the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) context. The proposed model handles uncertainties of experts' judgment around three primary parameters: the importance of organizational criteria, the impact of blockchain risks on criteria and the probability of risk occurrence. Findings: The case study shows that organizational “communication and information” is exposed to the most blockchain risk. On the contrary, blockchain has less to do with an organization's “corporate social responsibility.” Furthermore, effective blockchain risk management can bring about cost efficiency, quality and improved customer experience for this case study. In the end, the authors develop a conceptual blockchain risk management framework based on findings. Research limitations/implications: This study will broaden researchers' horizons regarding “blockchain in construction context” and “blockchain risk management.” Practical implications: Furthermore, executives looking for blockchain-based solutions can benefit from research findings and lessons learned from this case study before decision-making. Lastly, the risk assessment model based on trapezoidal OPA-F can be used both for research purposes and industrial decision problems. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is for the first time that the OPA-F is employed in a risk assessment model. Also, the original OPA-F is extended to trapezoidal OPA-F using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and it is the first attempt to evaluate blockchain risks facing construction organizations and develop a blockchain risk management framework accordingly.","Blockchain Technology; Construction Organizations; Distributed Ledger Technology; Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach; Multi-criteria Decision-making; Risk assessment; Decision Making; Distributed Ledger; Fuzzy Sets; Industrial Research; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Block-chain; Blockchain Technology; Construction Organizations; Distributed Ledg Technology; Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach; Multi Criteria Decision-making; Multicriteria Decision-making; Multicriterion Decision Makings; Priority Approach; Risks Assessments; Blockchain","Decision making; Distributed ledger; Fuzzy sets; Industrial research; Risk assessment; Risk management; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Construction organizations; Distributed ledg technology; Fuzzy ordinal priority approach; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Priority approach; Risks assessments; Blockchain","Funding text 1: The authors thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their important suggestions.

Metaorganizations represent collectives of organizations that function collectively to achieve shared goals and objectives. The study underscores the significant influence of DI on CSR initiatives, suggesting that firms should strategically align their digital innovation endeavors with their CSR objectives. Alignment between digital innovation and CSR objectives can cultivate a more integrated strategy that delivers both business and societal value. Furthermore, our findings reveal that firms operating under conditions of higher value appropriation, partner concentration, and environmental uncertainty tend to be more proactive in their CSR efforts within the DI context. This observation stems from a noticeable shift in primary focus: value creation and capture are no longer exclusive goals, but, rather, there is an increased emphasis on social benefits. This change necessitates a strategic recalibration by firms to incorporate a more robust focus on sustainability and social responsibility within their business models in the digital era. Our hypotheses are substantiated by results obtained from a longitudinal sample of Chinese listed firms.

The aim of this study is to conduct a thorough analysis of existing research on employee engagement. To accomplish this aim, 786 articles concerning employee engagement indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) between the years 2002 and 2022 were analyzed using bibliometric analysis methods. The VOSviewer program was employed to conduct citation, co-citation, co-authorship, and co-occurrence analysis. The study identified the leading countries, institutions, authors, journals, and scientific publications on the topic and shed light on current research patterns and future research avenues. The results demonstrate that the most productive country is the USA, the most productive institution is the University of Louisville, the most productive author is Brad Shuck, and the most productive journal is Sustainability. The current trend of research involves exploring the antecedents (e.g., corporate social responsibility, perceived organizational support, organizational culture, work–family balance) and consequences (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, employee performance, organizational citizenship behavior) of employee engagement. However, further research is necessary to explore the impact of various leadership styles, digital technologies, and new ways of working on employee engagement.","Bibliometric Analysis; Employee Engagement; Human Resource Management; Organizational Behavior; Bibliography; Citizenship; Leadership; Research Work; Sustainability; Visualization; Kentucky; Louisville; United States","bibliography; citizenship; leadership; research work; sustainability; visualization; Kentucky; Louisville; United States","","Bp Int Res Crit Inst J Birci J, (2022); 2018 Trends in Global Employee Engagement; Global Workplace Study 2022 Full Research Report; State of the Global Workplace 2022 Report, (2025); Harter, James K., Business-unit-level relationship between employee satisfaction, employee engagement, and business outcomes: A meta-analysis, Journal of Applied Psychology, 87, 2, pp. 268-279, (2002); Industrial and Organizational Psychology, (2008); Kahn, William A., Psychological conditions of personal engagement and disengagement at work, Academy of Management Journal, 33, 4, pp. 692-724, (1990); Maslach, Christina, Job burnout, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 397-422, (2001); J, Anitha, Determinants of employee engagement and their impact on employee performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 63, 3, pp. 308-323, (2014); Al Mehrzi, Nada, Competing through employee engagement: a proposed framework, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 65, 6, pp. 831-843, (2016)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165033074"

The results of the empirical analysis show that the level of digital finance development has a significant positive impact on corporate ESG performance, with financing constraints playing a mediating role in this path. In the heterogeneity analysis, we find that this impact shows a more significant effect among non-state-owned enterprises as well as enterprises in the central and western regions. The findings of the article’s empirical tests show that the continuous development of digital finance helps enterprises enable social responsibility, which has certain implications for the synergy between financial institutions, government departments, and corporate entities to promote high-quality economic development.","Digital Finance; Esg; Financing Constraints; Social Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Development; Investment; Spatiotemporal Analysis; China","corporate social responsibility; economic development; investment; spatiotemporal analysis; China","This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Funding No. 15XJY022).","Xue, Yan, Corporate Social Responsibility and High-quality Development: Do Green Innovation, Environmental Investment and Corporate Governance Matter?, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 58, 11, pp. 3191-3214, (2022); Mbanyele, William, Corporate social responsibility and green innovation: Evidence from mandatory CSR disclosure laws, Economics Letters, 212, (2022); Shalhoob, Hebah S., Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Disclosure and the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Sustainability Performance, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 1, (2023); Zhang, Lu, Digital Inclusive Finance, Financing Constraints, and Technological Innovation of SMEs—Differences in the Effects of Financial Regulation and Government Subsidies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 9, (2023); Ma, Fenfen, Digital Transformation and Corporate Environmental Green Innovation Nexus: An Approach towards Green Innovation Improvement, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 7, (2023); Dai, Debao, Can Digital Inclusive Finance Help Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Deleverage in China?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 8, (2023); Aqabna, Sharif Mohammad, Firm Performance, Corporate Social Responsibility and the Impact of Earnings Management during COVID-19: Evidence from MENA Region, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023); Jia, Fang, Institutional Shareholders and Firm ESG Performance: Evidence from China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 22, (2022); Chang, Yujin, How Does the Degree of Competition in an Industry Affect a Company’s Environmental Management and Performance?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 9, (2023); Zhao, Yan, Environmental, Social and Governance Performance: Analysis of CEO Power and Corporate Risk, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 2, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164946706"

On the other hand, global pressures for corporate social responsibility in the sustainable production of products are increasing. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to develop and validate an instrument to measure the impact of digital supply chain (DSC) activities on the sustainable performance of manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, through an in-depth study of the relevant literature, a conceptual model was developed and a questionnaire containing 51 indicators was designed. The questionnaire was distributed among 356 top managers and experts of the Iranian manufacturing companies, whereby finally 233 sound questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of about 64%. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify constructs and sub-constructs and the relationship between them was investigated using the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) method. Findings: Based on the obtained results, three constructs were identified, namely main activities (including sub-constructs: digital supplier, digital manufacturing, digital logistics and innovation and digital customer), support activities (with sub-constructs digital performance, DT and digital human resources) and sustainable performance (with sub-constructs of economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and social sustainability). The designed tool has excellent psychometric properties. The values of t-statistic = 11.07 and β = 0.602 indicate the positive impact of the DSC main activities on sustainable performance. Similarly, t = 2.42 and β = 0.149 prove that DSC support activities have a positive impact on sustainable performance. Also, based on the obtained values (t = 13.16 and β = 0.629), support activities have a significant impact on the main activities of the DSC. Finally, based on the calculated goodness-of-fit (GoF) index value (0.522), this paper concluded that the proposed model has high credibility. Research limitations/implications: Validation of the model is based on the answers received from the Iranian manufacturing companies. Therefore, caution should be taken regarding the generalizability of the results. Practical implications: The proposed model presents a holistic view of the application of DTs in the supply chain and the DTs' impact on sustainable performance which might help manufacturing companies, particularly the Iranian companies to obtain a broader knowledge of the importance of DTs and DTs' usage toward responding to the challenges of today's complex business environment. Originality/value: This study is among the first of the study's kind that attempts to develop and validate an instrument to measure the impact of DSC activities on the sustainable performance of manufacturing companies.","Digital Supply Chain; Digital Technologies; Exploratory Factor Analysis (efa); Pls-sem Technique; Sustainable Performance","","","Abdoli Bidhandi, Reza, Effects of supply chain agility on profitability, Business Process Management Journal, 23, 5, pp. 1064-1082, (2017); Agrawal, Prakash, Digital supply chain management: An Overview, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 455, 1, (2018); Alharthi, Shaker, An Exploration of the Role of Blockchain in the Sustainability and Effectiveness of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain, IBIMA Business Review, 2020, (2020); Attaran, Mohsen, Digital technology enablers and their implications for supply chain management, Supply Chain Forum, 21, 3, pp. 158-172, (2020); Bagheri Rad, Marjan, An Empirical Investigation of the Factors Affecting the Use of Social Networks in Human Resources Recruitment, International Journal of Public Administration, 43, 6, pp. 517-526, (2020); Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta, Digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains in the 21st century: A review and a research agenda, Science of the Total Environment, 725, (2020); Dadashnejad, Ali Asghar, Investigating the effect of value stream mapping on operational losses: a case study, Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology, 16, 3, pp. 478-500, (2018); Delić, Mia, The effect of additive manufacturing adoption on supply chain flexibility and performance: An empirical analysis from the automotive industry, International Journal of Production Economics, 228, (2020); Deniz, Melike S., Assessing the validity and reliability of a questionnaire on dietary fibre-related knowledge in a Turkish student population, Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition, 31, 4, pp. 497-503, (2013); Di Vaio, Assunta, Blockchain technology in supply chain management for sustainable performance: Evidence from the airport industry, International Journal of Information Management, 52, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","17410398","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150656111"

This study utilizes text mining and IPCC methods (based on The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change standards) to assess the level of digital transformation and enterprise carbon emission intensity among Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2015. This study also investigates the impact of digital transformation on enterprise carbon emission intensity and examines the influence of myopic characteristics among managers along with their underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that: (1) Digital transformation decreases enterprise carbon emission intensity, with robust results supported by instrumental variable test, the Oster test, confounding variable threshold impact test, etc. (2) Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that digital transformation is particularly effective in reducing enterprise carbon emission intensity for companies located in cities without national carbon trading pilot policies, heavy industrial sectors, and those influenced by peer effects. (3) The study on mechanisms reveals that management myopia poses a barrier to the decarbonization process driven by digitalization. It further explores the moderating effects of green innovation, sustainable investment, and environmental awareness, revealing that management constrained by innovation myopia, investment myopia, and environmental responsibility myopia faces challenges in promoting decarbonization. By examining the internal aspects of management myopia, we provide valuable insights and recommendations for enterprises seeking to achieve decarbonization through digital transformation.","Carbon Emission Intensity; Corporate Sustainability; Digital Transformation; Managerial Myopia; Upper Echelons Theory; Carbon Emission; Corporate Strategy; Digitization; Emission Inventory; Implementation Process; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change; Pollution Policy; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Transformation; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","carbon emission; corporate strategy; digitization; emission inventory; implementation process; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; pollution policy; strategic approach; sustainability; transformation; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","","Ghobakhloo, Morteza, Industry 4.0, innovation, and sustainable development: A systematic review and a roadmap to sustainable innovation, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 8, pp. 4237-4257, (2021); Yi, Ming, Effects of digital economy on carbon emission reduction: New evidence from China, Energy Policy, 171, (2022); van Tonder, Chanté, A framework for digital transformation and business model innovation, Management, 25, 2, pp. 111-132, (2020); Verhoef, Peter C., Digital transformation: A multidisciplinary reflection and research agenda, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 889-901, (2021); Academy of Management Review, (1984); Holmström, Bengt R., Managerial incentive problems: A dynamic perspective, Review of Economic Studies, 66, 1, pp. 169-182, (1999); Narayanan, M.

However, there are new sets of responsibilities associated with the deployment of these technologies, encompassed within the emerging concept of corporate digital responsibility (CDR), which to date has received little attention in the academic literature.

Enhancing customers’ perception of value co-creation with banks is a critical issue that requires attention. This study aims to explore the impact and mechanism of a bank’s social responsibility practices on its customers’ value co-creation in the digital context. A cross-level analysis model was developed and analyzed based on in-depth surveys of 30 bank managers and 262 valid customers. The results reveal that (1) CSR practices have no impact on customer value co-creation in the digital context; (2) CSR practices have a positive impact on customers’ perception of a company’s social responsibility; (3) customers’ perception of a company’s social responsibility has a positive impact on customer value co-creation; and (4) customers’ perception plays a mediating role between CSR practices and customer value co-creation. Although corporate social responsibility is becoming increasingly important in the current digital economy, our study found that it does not necessarily lead to more customer value co-creation. Banks must enable customers to perceive their CSR practices in order to foster value co-creation. This study has important implications for banking practitioners seeking to strengthen their social responsibility practices and create value with their customers in the digital era.","Corporate Social Responsibility Practices; Customer Perception; Digitization; Value Co-creation; Banking; Corporate Social Responsibility; Perception; Questionnaire Survey; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Taiwan Bank; Taiwan Strait","banking; corporate social responsibility; perception; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; Taiwan Bank; Taiwan Strait","This research was funded by the Huaqiao University Philosophy and Social Science Young Scholars Development project (20SKGC-QG07) and Chinese Social Science Foundation, grant number 21CGL018.","Zhao, Chenyu, Research on the Impact of Digital Transformation on Corporate Social Responsibility, Modern Economic Science, 44, 2, pp. 109-116, (2022); Philosophy of Management, (1923); International Review of Management and Business Research, (2014); Academy of Management Review, (1985); Academy of Management Review, (1991); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate Social Responsibility: Perspectives on the CSR Construct’s Development and Future, Business and Society, 60, 6, pp. 1258-1278, (2021); Business and Society Ethics Sustainability and Stakeholder Management, (2012); Dupire, Marion, CSR Strategies in Response to Competitive Pressures, Journal of Business Ethics, 148, 3, pp. 603-623, (2018); Luu, Trong Tuan, CSR and Customer Value Co-creation Behavior: The Moderation Mechanisms of Servant Leadership and Relationship Marketing Orientation, Journal of Business Ethics, 155, 2, pp. 379-398, (2019); Mubushar, Muhammad, The impact of corporate social responsibility activities on stakeholders' value co-creation behaviour, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 28, 6, pp. 1906-1920, (2021)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163086107"

Further analysis shows that the local digital economy has varying impacts on distinct dimensions of CSR, with more pronounced effects observed among state-owned enterprises, firms in secondary industries, large-scale and non-digital firms. Overall, these findings suggest that the development of the digital economy fosters the willingness of firms to engage in CSR, resulting in a favorable interaction between firms and stakeholders.","Corporate Governance; Csr; Digital Economy; Entropy Method; Online Media; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Strategy; Digitization; Governance Approach; Industrial Performance; China","corporate social responsibility; corporate strategy; digitization; governance approach; industrial performance; China","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (72203048) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515110226).","Fatima, Tahniyath, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Implementation: A Review and a Research Agenda Towards an Integrative Framework, Journal of Business Ethics, 183, 1, pp. 105-121, (2023); Chen, Roger C.Y., Assessing whether corporate social responsibility influence corporate value, Applied Economics, 49, 54, pp. 5547-5557, (2017); Chkir, Imed Eddine, Does corporate social responsibility influence corporate innovation?

This article examines the industry’s approach to the core sustainability concept and the CE in particular through a review of the available academic literature, evidence from corporate sustainability reports and websites, and feedback from an online survey of industry professionals. More specifically, the article investigates how German T&C companies are addressing sustainability in their corporate strategies and what activities relating to the CE are being pursued in the industry. The role of digital technologies in the transition to sustainability and the CE in the German T&C industry is also explored. The study finds that whilst sustainability is now firmly embedded at the strategic level in the vast majority of the companies studied, attitudes towards the CE are mixed. The use of digital technologies in support of sustainability objectives is also limited at present, but the need to meet compliance requirements and new customer perceptions of sustainability will speed the transition to CE activities, which will be facilitated by the greater exploitation of these technologies. An operational framework for initiating such a transition is developed, and action lists in the key areas of change organization, products, and processes are presented. These may be used as a guideline for practitioners, and the findings also make a small contribution to the scarcity of literature in this field of research.","Ce; Circular Economy; Clothing Industry; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Digital Technology; Digitalisation; Operational Framework; Sustainable Development; Textile Industry; Clothing Industry; Compliance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Guideline; Recycling; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Textile Industry","clothing industry; compliance; corporate social responsibility; digitization; guideline; recycling; sustainability; sustainable development; textile industry","","Sustainability Strategy for Textiles; Closing the Loop an Eu Action Plan for the Circular Economy, (2015); Alonso-Muñoz, Sara, New circular networks in resilient supply chains: An external capital perspective, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Circular Economy Action Plan; Circular Textiles Prospering in the Circular Economy; Okorie, Okechukwu S., Digitisation and the circular economy: A review of current research and future trends, Energies, 11, 11, (2018); Wynn, Martin George, Digital Technology Deployment and the Circular Economy, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 15, (2022); Why Digitalization is Critical to Creating A Global Circular Economy; Kottmeyer, Benjamin, Digitisation and Sustainable Development: The Opportunities and Risks of Using Digital Technologies for the Implementation of a Circular Economy, Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Emerging Economies, 7, 1, pp. 17-23, (2021); Ranta, Valtteri, Digital technologies catalyzing business model innovation for circular economy—Multiple case study, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 164, (2021)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161605342"

However, studies on how concurrent innovation techniques affect performance is scarce. To study the complementarity/substitutability in the effectiveness of various forms of innovation, this study examines the combined usage of six different types of innovation. Data from a sample of 1200 Chinese manufacturing Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were used for the empirical investigation. We find that digital platforms have a positive effect on the capacity reconfiguration of SMEs and business model innovation. This study examines the relationship between stakeholder interactions, reverse knowledge sharing, open innovation (OI) initiatives, and SMEs’ performance in several Chinese industries. The results show that OI initiatives are statistically negligible compared with SMEs’ total performance. We also discover that the link between platforms and CSR business model innovation is mediated by the reorganization of developmental capacity and reconfiguration of substitutional capabilities. In addition to having significant managerial ramifications for policymakers and CSR, to assist businesses in executing technological solutions, these results provide a theoretical contribution to the study of digital platforms and SMEs.","Business Model; Chinese Smes; Innovation; Open Innovation Initiatives; Stakeholder Interactions","","","Agyekum, Ephraim Bonah, A bird's eye view of Ghana's renewable energy sector environment: A Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach, Utilities Policy, 70, (2021); Al Asbahi, Ahmed Abdulwali Mohammed Haidar, Novel approach of Principal Component Analysis method to assess the national energy performance via Energy Trilemma Index, Energy Reports, 5, pp. 704-713, (2019); Ali, Muhammad Mahboob, Comparative positioning of Small and Medium Enterprises in Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philippines, Economy of Regions, 13, 2, pp. 381-395, (2017); Azad, Md Abul Kalam, Bank efficiency in Bangladesh revisited: a slack-based network DEA approach, Journal of Economic Studies, 47, 5, pp. 1001-1014, (2020); Caballero-Morales, Santiago Omar, Innovation as recovery strategy for SMEs in emerging economies during the COVID-19 pandemic, Research in International Business and Finance, 57, (2021); Data Envelopment Analysis Theory Methodology and Applications, (1994); Cheval, Sorin, Observed and potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the environment, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 11, pp. 1-25, (2020); Cline, Brandon N., Shareholder investment horizons and bank debt financing, Journal of Banking and Finance, 110, (2020); Fang, Wei, Role of research and development in green economic growth through renewable energy development: Empirical evidence from South Asia, Renewable Energy, 194, pp. 1142-1152, (2022); Feyen, Erik, Financial Sector Policy Response to COVID-19 in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, Journal of Banking and Finance, 133, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","22042296","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160043068"

Clothing production and transportation generate a large volume of waste and high greenhouse gas emissions, often exploiting cheap labour in developing countries. Consequently, stakeholders are becoming more aware of the environmental and human rights implications of the apparel industry. This paper aims to investigate how fashion companies are redesigning their value chain to meet growing stakeholder demands for sustainability and circular economy. Using purposeful sampling, a qualitative multiple case study design involving 21 Italian apparel companies adopting circular business models was conducted. Data were collected through remote semi-structured interviews, supplemented by secondary data to provide a richer context for our investigation. The research findings are interpreted through the theoretical lens of Institutional theory, showing the primary factors leading to the transition from fast to slow fashion business models. Notably, customer demand for supply chain transparency and the selection of certified suppliers strongly influence the development of apparel firms' business models, pushing companies to a radical change in their value proposition, creation, and delivery. This study guides practitioners, highlighting circular business model innovations and emerging digital technologies enabling apparel businesses to manage stakeholder engagement and promote sustainable development strategically.","Apparel Industry; Circular Economy; Corporate Social Responsibility; Slow Fashion; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainability; Developing Countries; Economic And Social Effects; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Sustainable Development; Apparel Industry; Business Models; Circular Economy; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Pollutions; Exploratory Analysis; Large Volumes; Production And Transportations; Slow Fashion; Stakeholder Engagement; Supply Chains","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Apparel industry; Business models; Circular economy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental pollutions; Exploratory analysis; Large volumes; Production and transportations; Slow fashion; Stakeholder engagement; Supply chains","","Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan, Emerging Halal food market: an Institutional Theory of Halal certificate implementation, Management Research Review, 39, 9, pp. 987-997, (2016); Aguilera-Caracuel, Javier, Green Innovation and Financial Performance: An Institutional Approach, Organization and Environment, 26, 4, pp. 365-385, (2013); Andriolo, Alessandro, Haulage sharing approach to achieve sustainability in material purchasing: New method and numerical applications, International Journal of Production Economics, 164, pp. 308-318, (2015); Axsen, Jonn, Social influence and consumer preference formation for pro-environmental technology: The case of a U.K. workplace electric-vehicle study, Ecological Economics, 95, pp. 96-107, (2013); Baden-Fuller, Charles W.F., Business models as models, Long Range Planning, 43, 2-3, pp. 156-171, (2010); Bag, Surajit, Effect of eco-innovation on green supply chain management, circular economy capability, and performance of small and medium enterprises, Journal of Business Research, 141, pp. 60-72, (2022); Baldassarre, Brian, Addressing the design-implementation gap of sustainable business models by prototyping: A tool for planning and executing small-scale pilots, Journal of Cleaner Production, 255, (2020); Qualitative Data Analysis with Nvivo, (2007); Bocken, Nancy M.P., Product design and business model strategies for a circular economy, Journal of Industrial and Production Engineering, 33, 5, pp. 308-320, (2016); Bocken, Nancy M.P., A literature and practice review to develop sustainable business model archetypes, Journal of Cleaner Production, 65, pp. 42-56, (2014)","","Elsevier B.V.","09255273","","IJPCE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150482516"

The aim is to contribute a nuanced understanding of how offline initiatives are framed and the complex relationship between individual and collective action. The study is based on qualitative interviews with ten organisers representing different initiatives and supplementary material from mass and digital media. The analysis shows how actions are triggered by personal experiences and respond to specific concerns within domains such as work and education, tourism and leisure, arts, culture and religion. Yet, the initiatives also invoke overlapping moral evaluations. The study reveals a joint scepticism concerning the lack of industry responsibility and little faith in regulatory solutions to the problem of intrusive media. Furthermore, the study discusses digital detox initiatives as an ambiguous form of contemporary activism, spanning from self-help to corporate action. The initiatives are not connected, but participants perceive their actions as part of an emerging trend. Nevertheless, few initiatives contribute to an interpretation of disconnection initiatives as anything more than unique experiences. The article contributes to the extant literature by showing how the meaning of disconnection evolves both in local settings and in dialogue with broader concerns in the public sphere.","Activism; Digital Detox; Digital Media; Disconnection; Framing; Media Resistance; Offline; Social Media","","Funding text 1: The author is grateful to Professor Faltin Karlsen for collaboration in the two relevant projects and to research assistants Jørgen Bolling, Eva Fredriksen Solum and Ragnhild-Marie Nerheim.

The findings of the linear regression analysis revealed that there is an insignificant direct relationship between eco-efficiency and corporate sustainability performance, while there is a significant moderating impact of EMA on the linkage between eco-efficiency and corporate environmental sustainability, and this significant moderating impact also applied to the linkage between digital applications and corporate environmental sustainability. This study provides good insights into the domain of environmental sustainability performance on the business scale in the Saudi context as an emerging economy, as it could be considered an innovative contribution to theoretical and practical aspects in the recent green issue adoption context; theoretically, it provides additional evidence of the role of digital EMA in improving environmental sustainability performance, and practically, the study findings can be beneficial for strategy and policymakers in corporations and regulators of environmental sustainability performance.","Corporate Environmental Sustainability Performance; Digital Technologies; Eco-efficiency; Environmental Management Accounting Ema; Biotechnology; Corporate Social Responsibility; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Management; Manufacturing; Regression Analysis; Sustainability","biotechnology; corporate social responsibility; energy efficiency; environmental management; manufacturing; regression analysis; sustainability","This research project was supported by the Institutional Funding Track 2022 provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education to King Faisal University, and the grant number is INST147.","Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz, When titans meet – Can industry 4.0 revolutionise the environmentally-sustainable manufacturing wave?

In the dual context of building a digital inclusive financial system and green transformation of corporate production, this paper explores the impact of digital inclusive finance on corporate ESG performance and its mechanism of action through theoretical and empirical analyses using data of Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2011 to 2020. It is found that the development of digital inclusive finance significantly contributes to the improvement of corporate ESG performance, and the impact of digital inclusive finance on corporate ESG performance has a marginal decreasing effect, while corporate green technology innovation has a marginal increasing effect on corporate ESG performance. The mechanism analysis found that corporate green technology innovation has a mediating effect. The development of digital inclusive finance can enhance the green technology innovation ability of enterprises, and the green technology innovation of enterprises enhances the green sustainability ability of enterprises and improves the ESG performance of corporates. Further research shows that the effects of digital inclusive finance and corporate green technology innovation on corporate ESG performance are industry heterogeneous and pollution degree heterogeneous. How to promote financial services to better promote the combination of corporate green development and fulfillment of social and environmental responsibility is the most direct research implication of this paper.","Corporate Esg Performance; Digital Inclusive Finance; Green Technology Innovation; Digitization; Finance; Financial Services; Financial System; Green Economy; Green Job; Industry; Innovation; Pollution; Sustainability; Asian; China; Human; Organization; Technology; Asian People; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Organizations; Technology","digitization; finance; financial services; financial system; green economy; green job; industry; innovation; pollution; sustainability; Asian; China; human; organization; technology; Asian People; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Organizations; Technology","This paper was funded by 2020 Henan Provincial Higher Education University “Young Backbone Teacher Training Program”; “Research on the Performance Evaluation and Improvement Path of China’s New Urbanization High-Quality Development” (2020GGJS092); and 2022 Henan Provincial Annual Project of Philosophy and Social Science Planning “Research on the Welfare Effect and Enhancement Mechanism of Rural Digital Inclusive Finance” (2022BJJ041).","Acemoglu, Daron, The environment and directed technical change, American Economic Review, 102, 1, pp. 131-166, (2012); Aghion, Philippe, Credit constraints and the cyclicality of R&D investment: Evidence from France, Journal of the European Economic Association, 10, 5, pp. 1001-1024, (2012); Aziz, Abdul, Rethinking digital financial inclusion: Evidence from Bangladesh, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); Berg, Tobias, On the Rise of FinTechs: Credit Scoring Using Digital Footprints, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 7, pp. 2845-2897, (2020); Bolton, Patrick, Do investors care about carbon risk?, Journal of Financial Economics, 142, 2, pp. 517-549, (2021); Chouaibi, Salim, ESG and corporate financial performance: the mediating role of green innovation: UK common law versus Germany civil law, EuroMed Journal of Business, 17, 1, pp. 46-71, (2022); Christensen, Dane M., Why is Corporate Virtue in the Eye of The Beholder?

Responsible innovation, as a new management paradigm that balances profit growth and social value, plays an important role in promoting enterprise's risk resistance and sustainable development. However, there are still few existing research on how to stimulate enterprises to implement responsible innovation. Based on the dynamic capability theory (DCT) and contingency theory, this study explores how strategic orientations affect responsible innovation under various degrees of environmental turbulence. Hierarchical regression was used to test the conceptual model based on data collected from 194 Chinese SMEs. The results indicate that strategic orientations (digital and environmental orientations) positively affect responsible innovation, and environmental orientation plays a stronger role in promoting responsible innovation than digital orientation. Market and technological turbulences play positive moderating roles in the relationship between digital orientation and responsible innovation, while negatively moderating the relationship between environmental orientation and responsible innovation. These findings are helpful to enrich the literature on strategic orientation and responsible innovation and provide practical implications for guiding SMEs to implement responsible innovation.","Digital Orientation; Environmental Orientation; Environmental Turbulence; Responsible Innovation; Smes; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Strategy; Innovation; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Sustainable Development; China","corporate social responsibility; corporate strategy; innovation; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainable development; China","This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (20BGL059).

Using the lens of corporate digital responsibility (CDR), we examine these risks and their mitigation in service firms and make five contributions. First, we show that CDR is critical in service contexts because of the vast streams of customer data involved and digital service technology’s omnipresence, opacity, and complexity. Second, we synthesize the ethics, privacy, and fairness literature using the CDR data and technology life-cycle perspective to understand better the nature of these risks in a service context. Third, to provide insights on the origins of these risks, we examine the digital service ecosystem and the related flows of money, service, data, insights, and technologies. Fourth, we deduct that the underlying causes of CDR issues are trade-offs between good CDR practices and organizational objectives (e.g., profit opportunities versus CDR risks) and introduce the CDR calculus to capture this. We also conclude that regulation will need to step in when a firm’s CDR calculus becomes so negative that good CDR is unlikely. Finally, we advance a set of strategies, tools, and practices service firms can use to manage these trade-offs and build a strong CDR culture.","Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Data; Ethics; Fairness; Privacy","","","Akter, Shahriar, Algorithmic bias in data-driven innovation in the age of AI, International Journal of Information Management, 60, (2021); Andrew, Jane, The General Data Protection Regulation in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Journal of Business Ethics, 168, 3, pp. 565-578, (2021); Written Testimony in Hearing on Machines Artificial Intelligence the Workforce Recovering Readying Our Economy for the Future, (2020); Awad, Edmond, Computational ethics, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 388-405, (2022); Awad, Neveen Farag, The personalization privacy paradox: An empirical evaluation of information transparency and the willingness to be profiled online for personalization, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 1, pp. 13-28, (2006); Bailey, Catherine, Building an ethically strong organization, MIT Sloan Management Review, 60, 1, pp. 75-81, (2018); Beke, Frank T., Consumer informational privacy: Current knowledge and research directions, Foundations and Trends in Marketing, 11, 1, pp. 1-71, (2018); Belk, Russell V., Ethical issues in service robotics and artificial intelligence, Service Industries Journal, 41, 13-14, pp. 860-876, (2021); Harvard Business Review, (2020); Bleier, Alexander, Consumer privacy and the future of data-based innovation and marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 37, 3, pp. 466-480, (2020)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","15527379; 10946705","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139447621"

The results show that (1) the digitalization level of enterprises can promote the improvement of green innovation, and this is not affected by the nature of property rights and the region of enterprises; (2) there is a partial mediating effect of government subsidies in the relationship between the digitalization level of enterprises and green innovation, and enterprises can obtain more innovation resources and thus promote green innovation through the improvement of digitalization level, and this effect is stronger in enterprises in eastern regions than in other regions; (3) The relationship between digitalization level and green innovation is positively affected by the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility, and the promotion effect of digitalization level on green innovation is strengthened as the degree of fulfillment of corporate social responsibility increases. This article reveals the ways in which digitalization level influences enterprise green innovation, which further enriches the theoretical study of enterprise green innovation. The article provides policy suggestions for the government to improve the level of corporate green innovation and achieve the dual carbon goal; it also provides references for enterprises to build a multi-level influence mechanism to promote the improvement of the green innovation level based on the stakeholder theory.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitalization; Government Subsidies; Green Innovation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Government; Innovation; Property Rights; Stakeholder; Subsidy System; Theoretical Study","corporate social responsibility; digitization; government; innovation; property rights; stakeholder; subsidy system; theoretical study","This research was funded by the Social Science Planning Project of Shandong Province grant number 21BZBJ15.

Hence, our objectives are to know the combinational effect of the factors to determine a firm's high allocation of monetary resources to environmental issues and understand the role of the digital transformation process in the era of Industry 4.0 and its interaction with the internal-external variables proposed. In this sense, we conducted a comparative analysis of two representative emerging economies in Latin America, considering the external context of the companies (countries' competitiveness levels). We perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to focus on multiple conjectural causations that lead to the same outcome. The results show that small firms in a less competitive country carry out high environmental expenditures based on value creation rather than the regulatory environment. On the other hand, large firms in a highly competitive country carry out high environmental commitments to enhance legitimacy and improve external image. Finally, we found that the relationship between digitalization adoption and corporate environmental responsibility depends on a country's informality level. Thus, countries with high informality cannot successfully impact digitization and generate sustainable solutions.","Corporate Environmental Responsibility (cer); Digital Transformation Process; Emerging Economies; Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsqca); Industry 4.0; Climate Change; Economics; Fuzzy Sets; Image Enhancement; Corporate Environmental Responsibilities; Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Digital Transformation Process; Economy Firms; Emerging Economies; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analyse; Monetary Resources; Transformation Process; Industry 4.0","Climate change; Economics; Fuzzy sets; Image enhancement; Corporate environmental responsibilities; Corporate environmental responsibility; Digital transformation; Digital transformation process; Economy firms; Emerging economies; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyse; Monetary resources; Transformation process; Industry 4.0","Special acknowledgment to the Center of research at Universidad del Pacífico for supporting this research and the assistant researcher Jorge Peña Contreras for support on data processing.","Abbas, Jaffar, The effects of corporate social responsibility practices and environmental factors through a moderating role of social media marketing on sustainable performance of business firms, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 12, (2019); undefined, (2017); Ahlstrom, David, Private firms in China: Building legitimacy in an emerging economy, Journal of World Business, 43, 4, pp. 385-399, (2008); Ajwani-Ramchandani, Raji, Towards a circular economy for packaging waste by using new technologies: The case of large multinationals in emerging economies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 281, (2021); Akpan, Ikpe Justice, Digitization and technological transformation of small business for sustainable development in the less developed and emerging economies: a research note and call for papers, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 35, 5, pp. 671-676, (2023); Medimos Y Gestionamos Nuestro Impacto, (2019); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Talking trash: Legitimacy, impression management, and unsystematic risk in the context of the natural environment, Academy of Management Journal, 47, 1, pp. 93-103, (2004); Barbier, Edward B., Sustainable development goal indicators: Analyzing trade-offs and complementarities, World Development, 122, pp. 295-305, (2019); Barney, Jay Bryan, Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 643-650, (2001); Baumgartner, Rupert J., Organizational culture and leadership: Preconditions for the development of sustainable corporation, Sustainable Development, 17, 2, pp. 102-113, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149436809"

The authors explore the role of accounting in the operationalisation of “instrumentarian power” (Zuboff, 2019) – a new form of power that mobilises ubiquitous digital instrumentation to ensure that algorithmic architectures can tune, herd and modify behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a qualitative archival analysis of publicly available data related to the automation of welfare-policing systems to explore the role of accounting in advancing instrumentarian power. Findings: In exploring the automation of Australia's welfare debt recovery system (Robodebt), this paper examines a new algorithmic accountability that has emerged at the interface of government, technology and accounting. The authors show that accounting supports both the rise of instrumentarian power and the intensification of neoliberal ideals when buried within algorithms. In focusing on Robodebt, the authors show how the algorithmic reconfiguration of accountability within the welfare system intensified the inequalities that welfare recipients experienced. Furthermore, the authors show that, despite its apparent failure, it worked to modify welfare recipients' behaviour to align with the neoliberal ideals of “self-management” and “individual responsibility”. Originality/value: This paper addresses Agostino, Saliterer and Steccolini's (2021) call to investigate the relationship between accounting, digital innovations and the lived experience of vulnerable people. To anchor this, the authors show how algorithms work to mask the accounting assumptions that underpin them and assert that this, in turn, recasts accountability relationships. When accounting is embedded in algorithms, the ideological potency of calculations can be obscured, and when applied within technologies that affect vulnerable people, they can intensify already substantial inequalities.","Accounting; Algorithm; Apccountability; Instrumentarian Power; Robodebt; Surveillance Capitalism; Welfare Fraud Automation","","","Agostino, Deborah, How social media reshapes action on distant customers: some empirical evidence, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 4, pp. 777-794, (2017); Agostino, Deborah, New development: COVID-19 as an accelerator of digital transformation in public service delivery, Public Money and Management, pp. 1-4, (2020); Agostino, Deborah, Digitalization, accounting and accountability: A literature review and reflections on future research in public services, Financial Accountability and Management, 38, 2, pp. 152-176, (2022); Al-Htaybat, Khaldoon Abed, Big Data and corporate reporting: impacts and paradoxes, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 4, pp. 850-873, (2017); Alharthi, Amal, Surveillance capitalism in the middle east retail sector, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 87, (2022); Andrew, Jane, The General Data Protection Regulation in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Journal of Business Ethics, 168, 3, pp. 565-578, (2021); Andrew, Jane, Rationalising and resisting neoliberalism: The uneven geography of costs, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 45, pp. 12-28, (2017); Andrew, Jane, Free market environmentalism and the neoliberal project: The case of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 24, 6, pp. 397-409, (2013); Andrew, Jane, Accounting, inequality and COVID-19 in Australia, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 34, 6, pp. 1471-1483, (2021); Andrew, Jane, Data breaches in the age of surveillance capitalism: Do disclosures have a new role to play?, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 90, (2023)","","Emerald Publishing","09513574","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136502624"

Today other most vulnerable groups of the population are also involved in the management processes, such as: women, children, migrants, ethnic minorities, foreign citizens. In order to have high level of life and work for mentioned categories of citizens, state structures and companies should create conditions and advantages with a focus on the digital vector of economic development. The administration of companies in the leading sectors of the economy, which include energy, actively implements a policy of social responsibility towards employees in need, and this strategy applies to the whole society. That is why it is necessary to declare not only the willingness to bear social responsibility, but also information about the inclusion of the working environment should be public and subject to evaluation and analysis. The purpose of developing a digital vector of inclusion of the working environment in accordance with the ESG principles of responsible investment is to improve the quality and transparency of corporate policy to support disabled people and other stakeholders through the formation of transparent integrated reporting. These provisions are fundamentally transforming the global financial markets. The research methodology is based on determining the directions and indicators of inclusion of the working environment, which are reflected in integrated reports and reveal the directions and measures of the corporate management of energy companies on labor protection and organization, preparation of inclusion programs. The results obtained are based on a review of reports and indicators of rating agencies, an analysis of the best corporate governance practices of Russian energy companies.","","","","undefined; undefined; Esg Principles What They are and Why Companies Should Comply with Them; Antonova, Victoria K., Investment and inclusion as a norm of life: Attitudes of Russian HR-managers to inclusive employment, Zhurnal Issledovanii Sotsial'noi Politiki, 19, 3, pp. 373-388, (2021); Proceedings of the 34th International Business Information Management Association Conference Ibima, (2019); Vestnik of Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod Series Social Sciences, (2020); Upr Manag, (2019); Higher Education and the Labor Market in the Digital Economy the Development of Mathematical Methods and Tools for Studying Complex Economic Systems, (2021); Pavlenko, I.

Moreover, this study examined the role of affective commitment and gamification affordance within a single framework of customer response to DSR. The findings of an empirical study carried out in the DSR programs prove that the underlying psychological mechanisms between customer engagement in DSR and various customer outcomes are mediated by affective commitment and moderated by gamification affordance.

These parameters are compared with regressive, autoregressive, and moving average econometrical methods overtime to reach a conclusion on the impact of CSR on the share value during a digital transformation process. Results reveal that there is a directly relationship between corporate social responsibility and the share price measured by the MERCO ESG Ranking in the banking sector in Spain.

Firms develop their internal skills to deal with external challenges stemming from the digitalization process and the COVID-19 crisis. Founded on the dynamic capability view, our paper empirically tests how firms utilize their digital and creative capabilities to improve their performance during the pandemic and promote their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. The study conducted a two-step analysis. First, the data from 151 enterprises in Vietnam was collected and analyzed qualitatively to understand their digital capabilities and export performance. Then, the Smart PLS version 3 was utilized to analyze extended quantitative data of 329 SMEs in various industries. This study contributes to the theories of dynamic capability with the implications of developing digital and creative capabilities to enhance performance and CSR differentiation strategy in dealing with external challenges, especially in global pandemics. Firm performance plays a mediating role in the relationship between capabilities and CSR differentiation strategy. Our study also enriches the CSR literature by viewing CSR as firms' achieved targets or voluntary activities instead of as an instrument to boost firm performance.

Furthermore, digital servitization changes value creation processes and subsequently influences supply chain relationships and power structures. Further, the success of digital supply chains (DSC) is closely related to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practiced by the competing channels due to the resulting competitive environment. This study explores the optimality of competitive sustainability service, digitalization service, and pricing decisions under Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) game setting, Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game setting, Vertical Nash (VN), and integrated system (IS) model; therefore, it contributes to the literature on DSC systems which often focuses on optimizing price-only. In addition, it examines the environmental and economic benefits of taking advantage of green innovation products and digitalization processes. Results of implementing the model showed that when manufacturers combine digitalization, sustainability, and CSR activities, supply chain profits increase in all four power balance structures. However, the Model IS is sophisticated enough to synchronize the economic, environmental, and social gains of the system, leading to significant improvements in the performance indices. Furthermore, it is observed that the total DSC profit under the VN model is the highest. Whereas, manufacturers generate higher profits with Model MS, and retailers generate higher profits with Models RS and VN. Finally, we provide managers with guidance regarding the establishment of green innovation offerings by understanding the industrial organization's progress toward digitalization.","Digitalization; Green Process; Power Balance; Supply Chain; Sustainability; Costs; Supply Chain Management; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Supply Chain; Digitalization; Green Innovations; Green Process; Power Balance; Pricing Decision; Stackelberg; Stackelberg Games; Sustainable Process; Profitability","Costs; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Corporate social responsibility; Digital supply chain; Digitalization; Green innovations; Green process; Power balance; Pricing decision; Stackelberg; Stackelberg Games; Sustainable process; Profitability","","Addo-Tenkorang, Richard, Big data applications in operations/supply-chain management: A literature review, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 101, pp. 528-543, (2016); Journal of Modelling in Management, (2019); Akbari, Mohammadreza, Digital technologies as enablers of supply chain sustainability in an emerging economy, Operations Management Research, 15, 3-4, pp. 689-710, (2022); Ailawadi, Kusum L., Market power and performance: A cross-industry analysis of manufacturers and retailers, Journal of Retailing, 71, 3, pp. 211-248, (1995); Annals of Operations Research, (2020); Amaeshi, Kenneth M., Corporate social responsibility in supply chains of global brands: A boundaryless responsibility?

The study's originality emerges from using the most comprehensive panel time-series data available (1890–2019), adopting the most recent panel empirical modeling techniques. We use different estimation techniques fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), canonical cointegration regression (CCR) to evaluate whether the decarbonization process is significant and its progress comparing findings with mean-group error correction model with variable cross-sectional averages (CCEMG) for robustness. The results reported here underline that carbon emissions are slowing down, but the decarbonization process remains sluggish. Limiting factors for decarbonization are GDP per capita growth, population, capital intensity, total factor productivity, labor productivity, emissions inequality, high relative costs of renewables, economy structure (share of labor/capital intensive industries). The study results provide evidence countries with higher GDP per capita, total factor productivity growth, population growth, and increasing capital intensity drive global carbon emissions up. The findings of this study have several significant implications for global CO2 policymakers and carbon emissions reduction initiatives. It also has important implications for practitioners facing policy and technological choices toward corporate social responsibility management. This article provides new insights into empirical modeling for carbons emissions-effects under heterogeneity (endogeneity), non-stationarity, cross-sectional dependence, and unobservable technological progress effect.","Canonical Cointegration Regression; Carbon Emissions; Decarbonizations; Dynamic Ordinary Least Square; Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square; Mean-group Error Correction Model With Variable Cross-sectional Averages; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Decarbonization; Digital Storage; Emission Control; Error Correction; Canonical Cointegration Regression; Carbon Emissions; Cointegration; Decarbonisation; Dynamic Ordinary Least Square; Error Correction Models; Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square; Mean-group Error Correction Model With Variable Cross-sectional Average; Ordinary Least Squares; Population Statistics; Capital; Carbon Emission; Gross Domestic Product; Heterogeneity; Labor Productivity; Least Squares Method; Panel Data; Regression Analysis; Technological Development","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Digital storage; Emission control; Error correction; Canonical cointegration regression; Carbon emissions; Cointegration; Decarbonisation; Dynamic ordinary least square; Error correction models; Fully modified ordinary least square; Mean-group error correction model with variable cross-sectional average; Ordinary least squares; Population statistics; capital; carbon emission; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; labor productivity; least squares method; panel data; regression analysis; technological development","","Achour, Houda, Investigating the causal relationship between transport infrastructure, transport energy consumption and economic growth in Tunisia, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 988-998, (2016); Alam, M.

In this article, external and internal forms of CSR are found to be interconnected, and their adoption results in supercharged innovative performance.

In the business world, CSR endeavors are known as long-term focused strategic projects (Trotman & Bradley, 1981), and are believed to be inextricably linked with the main aim of innovation, given its emphasis on long-term sustainability and company success. However, there is no evident link between CSR and innovation and there are two opposing viewpoints on why companies participate in CSR programs in the first place. CSR proponents argue that it reduces the cost of capital and minimizes information asymmetry between managers and external capital providers, making it easier for innovative businesses to raise funds (e.g., Cho, Lee, & Pfeiffer, 2013; Cui, Jo, & Na, 2018). Strong relationships with important stakeholders, including employees, customers, and activist groups, can also promote a company's success in innovation. According to this view, CSR is favorably related to company innovation. On the other hand, an opposing view of CSR says that it is a technique for management to conceal unethical behavior or escape negative attention from the firm's stakeholders. CSR can stifle corporate innovation if approached this way. As a result, the question is whether CSR is linked to corporate innovation, and if so, how.Third, with help from USAID, the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) has been compiling the Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) annually since 2007. The PCI is a weighted average of ten component indicators that each measure a different aspect of business environment quality (entry costs, land access, and security of tenure; transparency and access to information; time costs and regulatory compliance; informal charges; policy bias; proactivity of provincial leadership; business support services; labor and training; legal institutions).

Combining in-depth case studies of detailed environmental disclosure histories of three companies with quantitative summaries of 263 such companies, we find that these companies learned to define the CSR term and adjust their disclosing behaviors gradually, from ad hoc mentioning of idiosyncratic themes to disclosing proliferating themes, often in the dedicated separate website section. Accompanying this change was the growth of global initiatives such as Global Compact and Global Reporting Initiatives and their disclosure guidelines.

Firm-specific factors include return on assets (ROA), market-to-book ratio (M/B ratio), size and leverage, whilst governance-related factors comprise board size, percentage of female board members, board independence and institutional ownership. All listed US firms over the period of 2011–2016 were analysed in this study. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides a novel method to empirically measure DT by combining multiple variables to create a combined DT score. The variables include security and privacy scores, security rankings and data breaches, amongst others. Subsequently, a linear regression was performed to evaluate the effect of firm- and governance-specific characteristics on DT, as well as the effect of DT on firm value. Findings: By using signalling theory, this study finds significant evidence that a firm’s profitability (ROA) decreases whilst its size increases DT. This could be due to the fact that firms with lower DT monetise data more actively, decrease DT and increase short-term profitability. Significant evidence also shows that increasing DT leads to an increase in firm value. Originality/value: Although numerous studies have been conducted on developing customers’ trust by incorporating corporate social responsibility to improve firm value, the literature remains still on its digital analogue. Therefore, this study extends the knowledge of corporate digital responsibility (CDR) by providing a novel method for calculating DT across industries as an antecedent of CDR. Specifically, it sheds light on how firms can enhance DT by utilising firm- and governance-level factors. This enhanced DT can subsequently increase firm value. The study provides important managerial implications by providing empirical evidence that cybersecurity investments increase firm value. This value increase is related to the rise in shareholder value amongst investors and the increase in the organisation’s consumer perceptions as the latter’s interests are better managed.","Corporate Digital Governance; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Cybersecurity; Digital Trust; Firm Value; Governance; Signalling Theory","","The authors would like to thank the editor in chief Prof Debbie Haski-Leventhal and the anonymous reviewers for the constructive comments that helped to improve the quality of this paper.","Abbasi, Kaleemullah, Audit committees, female directors and the types of female and male financial experts: Further evidence, Journal of Business Research, 114, pp. 186-197, (2020); MIT Sloan Manag Rev, (2019); Digital Trust Erase the Trust Paradox in Banking, (2016); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Aguilera, Ruth V., Codes of Good Governance Worldwide: What is the Trigger?, Organization Studies, 25, 3, pp. 415-443, (2004); Society and Business Review, (2017); Deloitte, (2019); Albitar, Khaldoon, Do assurance and assurance providers enhance COVID-related disclosures in CSR reports?

This method can better compare and analyze the social effects of each enterprise’s carbon accounts and provides a basis for overall carbon account construction and digging improvement space.","Carbon Account; Cfpr; Fuzzy Vikor; Social Effect; Variable Weight; Carbon; Carbon; Corporate Social Responsibility; Emission Control; Energy Use; Environmental Economics; Industrial Emission; Industrial Enterprise; Social Impact; Sustainable Development; Article; Carbon Footprint; Case Study; Controlled Study; Enterprise Carbon Account; Environmental Monitoring; Human; Model; Social Status; Variable Weight Cfpr Fuzzy Vikor; Carbon; Carbon; Sustainable Development","corporate social responsibility; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; industrial emission; industrial enterprise; social impact; sustainable development; Article; carbon footprint; case study; controlled study; enterprise carbon account; environmental monitoring; human; model; social status; variable weight CFPR Fuzzy VIKOR; carbon; Carbon; Sustainable Development","This research was funded by the Late supporting Project of National Social Science Foundation of China, grant number 21FGLB022; the Soft Science Project of Science department of Zhejiang Province, China, grant number 2022C35015; the Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, China, grant number 20GLE394 and 21JYB152; and the Quzhou Science and Technology Project, grant number 2022K99.","Zhao, Xin, Challenges toward carbon neutrality in China: Strategies and countermeasures, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 176, (2022); Wang, Xin, New challenges of the Belt and Road Initiative under China's “3060” carbon target, Journal of Cleaner Production, 376, (2022); Tian, Yuan, Will COVID-19 affect China's peak CO2 emissions in 2030?

Specifically, corporate digitized responsibility includes unbiased data acquisition, data protection, and data maintenance; corporate digitalized responsibility involves appropriate data interpretation, objective predicted results and tackling value conflicts in data-driven decision-making. Moreover, we also provide a valid measurement for CDR, and the findings demonstrate that a positive relationship exists between CDR and corporate digital performance.

For empirical verification of our thesis, we take a sample of 53 publicly listed Italian companies and look at data on their board composition, greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for the use of digital technologies of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) over a period of five years. What emerges from the test partially supports our predictions. In particular, we find that a higher level of board independence is associated with better environmental performance. There is no direct, statistically significant association between the use of digital technologies and environmental performance, so a greater use of digital technologies is not, in itself, sufficient to improve the environmental performance of a firm. However, our empirical analyses find that environmental performance is positively influenced by the use of digital technologies in firms that include a proportionately high number of independent directors on their boards. This research improves our understanding of antecedents of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), showing how the share of independent directors on a board has a positive impact on CDR, understood here as the set of practices and behaviours that help an organisation use data and digital technologies in ways that are environmentally responsible.","Board Of Directors; Corporate Digital Responsibility (cdr); Corporate Governance; Digital Transformation; Enterprise Resource Planning (erp); Environmental Impacts; Information Systems; Digitization; Empirical Analysis; Environmental Impact; Governance Approach; Information System; Planning Practice","digitization; empirical analysis; environmental impact; governance approach; information system; planning practice","","Kaplan, Robert Steven, Strategic performance measurement and management in nonprofit organizations, Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 11, 3, pp. 353-370, (2001); Anderson, Ronald C., Board composition: Balancing family influence in S&P 500 firms, Administrative Science Quarterly, 49, 2, pp. 209-237, (2004); Jensen, Michael C., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure, Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 4, pp. 305-360, (1976); Shleifer, Andrei, A survey of corporate governance, Journal of Finance, 52, 2, pp. 737-783, (1997); Berkeley Journal of International Law, (2008); McWilliams, Abagail, Corporate social responsibility: A theory of the firm perspective, Academy of Management Review, 26, 1, pp. 117-127, (2001); Academy of Management Journal, (1999); Kock, Carl Joachim, Corporate Governance and the Environment: What Type of Governance Creates Greener Companies?, Journal of Management Studies, 49, 3, pp. 492-514, (2012); Villiers, Charl De, The effect of board characteristics on firm environmental performance, Journal of Management, 37, 6, pp. 1636-1663, (2011); New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, (1991)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147879444"

We believe that digital transformation inhibits the short-term performance but increases the long-term value of transition economy firms. Furthermore, CSR and CSI have important contingency roles in the effectiveness of digital transformation. While CSR enhances the effectiveness of digital transformation, CSI weakens it. Finally, we believe that the enhancement role of CSR is weaker than the weakening role of CSI in the effectiveness of digital transformation. Using empirical data of Chinese listed companies from 2008 to 2020, we obtain empirical evidence confirming most of these theoretical views.

This assertion serves as the premise for this paper, exploring corporations that accept responsibility—or are being forced to take responsibility—for certain public issues because they are successful and, therefore, are seen as legitimate actors in the defence of individual rights in the digital age. Specifically, this paper extends the theoretical utility of applying a Foucauldian perspective of governmentality to the corporation, as set out in Collier and Whitehead’s (2021) Corporate Governmentality: Building the Empirical and Theoretical Case. In particular we seek to extend one of the Collier and Whitehead’s proposed typologies: forced governmentality. Using the Foucauldian analytical language of governmentality, it is possible to illuminate aspects of corporate governmental ambition that were previously unavailable through the current discourses. The crux of the issue consists of modern technologies that create governmental problems but are governed by the companies that created them. Consequently, the private sector actors that contribute to the creation technological problems are being forced to manage related action spaces. Using Facebook as a case study, this paper identifies the characteristics of forced governmentality through a critical reading of Mark Zuckerberg’s Blueprint for Content Governance and Enforcement.","Corporate Governmentality; Corporate Responsibility; Facebook; Forced Governmentality; Foucault; Governmentality; Social Media; Speech Practice; Corporate Governmentality; Corporate Responsibility; Corporates; Facebook; Forced Governmentality; Foucault; Governmentality; Social Media; Speech Practice; Blueprints; Corporate Social Responsibility; Government Relations; Private Sector; Public Sector; Social Media","Corporate governmentality; Corporate responsibility; Corporates; Facebook; Forced governmentality; Foucault; Governmentality; Social media; Speech practice; Blueprints; corporate social responsibility; government relations; private sector; public sector; social media","","Antipode, (2017); A Map of the Online World in Incredible Detail, (2021); 7 March Microsoft Teams, (2020); Barbrook, Richard, The Californian ideology, Science as Culture, 6, 1, pp. 44-72, (1996); Barkan, Joshua E., Corporate sovereignty: Law and government under capitalism, pp. 1-245, (2013); People Vs Tech how the Internet is Killing Democracy and how We Save It, (2018); Berkeley School of Information, (2019); Bloomberg News, (2021); 23 February, (2021); Seattle Times, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","15729893; 03432521","","GEOJD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129588877"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses case-based research. Data was collected in two large manufacturing companies based in Norway and Sweden through semi-structured interviews with two management representatives and four shop-floor employees. The data was used to evaluate 29 variables describing lean- and total quality management (TQM)-associated employee behaviours and soft management practices, in light of digital transformation. Findings: The results suggest that several variables were positively influenced by the digital transformation process. These were top management leadership, middle management involvement, employee education, corporate social responsibility focus, innovation, knowledge sharing, work-family balance, psychological capital, job satisfaction and career commitment. Training employees, creativity, discretionary effort, turnover intention and proactivity appear to be negatively influenced by digital transformation The findings also indicate that several soft management practices and employee behaviours were not only influenced by manufacturing digitalization but also themselves influenced the process. The potential for digital waste creation was also detected in several variables, including reward and recognition and training employees. Practical implications: Managers, practitioners and academics may learn about the importance of certain managerial practices and employees’ behavioural needs during the digital transformation process. The findings may help in prioritizing TQM and soft lean management practices and certain employee behaviours during the digital transformation and in creating awareness of digital waste. Originality/value: This study builds on several existing studies discussing the impact of digital transformation on soft management practices and employee behaviours. It provides insights from a lean and TQM angle and offers a means of prioritizing certain practices and behaviours during a digital transformation.

A literature review was developed, involving the seven variables: “Latin America,” “higher education,” corporate social responsibility,” “personal social responsibility,” “corporate sustainability,” “governance” and “sustainability.” A matrix was developed with 25 variable combinations, connecting the seven variables. Three questions have been proposed and answered: “How much research has been developed in the Latin American higher education?” “How can the corporate social sustainability be applied in higher education?” and “Which perspectives can be considered?” Findings: The results of the literature review are presented through the number of papers found with the analysis of the year of publication and the conceptual background. A total of 524 papers were found. Of these studies, 49 addressed the Latin American panorama, 33 had a general approach and 16 promoted interactions between Latin American and European countries, as well as between regions and continents. Six topics emerged from the literature analysis: digital inclusion, internationalization, innovation, research, servitization and social inclusion. These topics are connected in the “discussion” section, and the educational conceptual framework shows the corporative perspectives on sustainability in higher education. Originality/value: This research study presents “A conceptual framework for the corporate sustainability higher education in Latin America” and it brings some discussion topics: digital inclusion, internationalization, innovation, research, servitization and social inclusion. These topics were identified through the literature analysis, and they were applied in the conceptual framework to improve the quality of education. The implications of this study are connected with the conceptual framework to promote the discussion topics. The implications involved the public and private governance spheres, third sector, as well as the professors, students and other stakeholders of higher educational institutions. These implications can represent an agent of positive change in the Latin American scenario.","2030 Agenda; Conceptual Framework; Corporate Sustainability; Higher Education; Latin America","","This work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brazil – CAPES (Finance Code 001) and the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPq (grant numbers 311757/2018-9 and 311881/2019-0).","Abello-Romero, Juan Bautista, Relationship between disclosure of information and characteristics of latin American universities, Revista Venezolana de Gerencia, 23, pp. 67-89, (2018); Acioli, Carina, Applying Industry 4.0 technologies in the COVID–19 sustainable chains, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 70, 5, pp. 988-1016, (2021); Acosta-Vargas, Patricia, Challenges to assess accessibility in higher education websites: A comparative study of Latin america universities, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 36500-36508, (2018); Arksey, Hilary, Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory and Practice, 8, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Aslam, Farhan, Innovation in the era of IoT and industry 5.0: Absolute innovation management (AIM) framework, Information (Switzerland), 11, 2, (2020); Azevedo, Bruno Duarte, Urban solid waste management in developing countries from the sustainable supply chain management perspective: A case study of Brazil's largest slum, Journal of Cleaner Production, 233, pp. 1377-1386, (2019); Barbosa, F.

This paper aims to examine the relationship between the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars of a country’s development, green brand and digitalisation. To achieve the study’s goal, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied. The object of investigation was EU countries for 2016-2020. The findings allow us to conclude that a country's green brand is conducive to ESG performance by attracting green investment in renewable energies, social projects, and innovations. The results confirm that governments should prioritise sustainability initiatives, such as investing in renewable energy, adopting sustainable practices, and implementing environmental and social policies. Such efforts can enhance a country's green brand and lead to positive ESG outcomes, attracting more responsible businesses and investors. Moreover, digitalisation promoted governance by 0.142. The results showed that digitalisation could be a powerful tool for improving a country's green brand and ESG performance. Digital technologies can help countries monitor and manage environmental resources, promote sustainable practices, and engage with stakeholders.","Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure; Development Governance; Environmental Pollution; Good Governance; Sustainable Development","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine under grant; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine under grant number 0121U100468.","Bin Ab Hamid, Mohd Rashid, Discriminant Validity Assessment: Use of Fornell & Larcker criterion versus HTMT Criterion, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 890, 1, (2017); Aburumman, Omar Jaber, How to Deal with the Results of PLS-SEM?, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 495 LNNS, pp. 1196-1206, (2023); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Aouadi, Amal, Do ESG Controversies Matter for Firm Value?

In doing so, this study seeks to understand the forms of CSR commonly used in the marketing of health-care services by international MTPs. Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory quantitative content analysis methods are used to examine CSR communication provided by MTPs. Descriptive statistics and analyses of variance are used to analyze the data. Findings: Results show that 22% of MTP websites provided CSR information. There was a high degree of congruence or “fit” between the MTPs and the CSR. Furthermore, each MTP averaged between three and six CSR engagements demonstrating a commitment to not only the practice of CSR but also the stakeholders and communities who benefit. Research limitations/implications: This analysis focused on organizational websites and did not examine CSR communications delivered through alternative media channels (e.g. digital platforms, promotional brochures, print advertising, etc.). Practical implications: This study adds to the CSR framework in the medical tourism context by discovering what forms of CSR are commonly used in the marketing and promotion of international health services and further analyzes the strategic communication techniques used to deliver these messages. Social implications: CSR is argued to have direct impacts on employee satisfaction, investor relations and consumer behavior; therefore, current findings may contribute to the development of measurement tools for empirical studies that test relationships between the persuasiveness of CSR messages on the attitudes of medical tourists. Originality/value: Research inquiries into the CSR strategic communication practices help to identify strengths and opportunities, while informing reputation management and relationship-building practices.","Congruence; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Csr Communication; Health Destination Marketing; Medical Tourism","","","Academy of Management Journal, (1979); Agus Harjoto, Maretno Agus, Strategic and institutional sustainability: corporate social responsibility, brand value, and Interbrand listing, Journal of Product and Brand Management, 26, 6, pp. 545-558, (2017); Ahn, Jiseon, CSR perception and revisit intention: the roles of trust and commitment, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Insights, 3, 5, pp. 607-623, (2020); Aras, Güler, Managing corporate performance: Investigating the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in emerging markets, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 59, 3, pp. 229-254, (2010); Arvidsson, Susanne, Communication of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Study of the Views of Management Teams in Large Companies, Journal of Business Ethics, 96, 3, pp. 339-354, (2010); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Berglind, Matthew, Cause-related marketing: More buck than bang?, Business Horizons, 48, 5, pp. 443-453, (2005); Bhattacharya, C.

Design: Publicly available data were extracted from OFDS Instagram accounts. Posts published 6 months immediately before and after the first case of COVID-19 in Brazil were randomly sampled. Two independent authors coded the posts' content. Food and beverage items featured in posts were classified according to the NOVA food system classification. Marketing strategies were coded according to protocols from previous studies. Setting: Top three OFDS Instagram accounts in Brazil. Participants: Posts published in the period studied (n 304). Results: During the pandemic, the proportion of posts featuring at least one food item decreased from 71·6 % to 40·2 %, and the proportion of ultra-processed foods decreased from 57·6 % to 27·9 %. Before the pandemic, the most widely used marketing strategies were branding elements (80·7 %), product imagery (unbranded) (48·9 %) and partnerships/sponsorship (35·2 %). While during the pandemic, branding elements (62·2 %) continued to be the most applied, but were followed by the use of videos/graphics interchange format/boomerangs (34·1 %) and corporate social responsibility (31·7 %). The most frequent COVID-19 marketing strategies were 'social responsibility in the pandemic' (30·5 %), 'combatting the pandemic' (28·0 %) and 'accelerating digitalisation' (20·7 %). Conclusions: OFDS advertisements on a social media platform placed less emphasis on food items, but improved the nutritional quality of foods and beverages featured in posts. A COVID-washing approach was highlighted, especially through the use of social responsibility marketing during the pandemic.","Covid-19; Digital Food Environment; Digital Marketing; Food Promotion; Online Food Delivery Platforms; Social Media; Ultra-processed Food; Brazil; Case Report; Epidemiology; Food; Human; Marketing; Pandemic; Procedures; Social Media; Covid-19; Food; Humans; Marketing; Pandemics; Social Media","Brazil; case report; epidemiology; food; human; marketing; pandemic; procedures; social media; COVID-19; Food; Humans; Marketing; Pandemics; Social Media","Acknowledgements: Not applicable.

However, Chinese enterprises started late to understand the low-carbon economy. So far, except for a few state-owned enterprises, some leading private enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, they have made remarkable achievements in low-carbon emission reduction. Most enterprises in China have not realized the importance of low carbon emission reduction. In order to step out of the “high carbon” era and coordinate economic development and environmental protection, China must solve the problem of low-carbon transformation of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. How to measure the degree of low carbon transformation, and how the government objectively evaluates the degree of low carbon economic development of enterprises, with a view to formulating corresponding standard incentives and punishment measures for them. It is urgent to establish a sound, reasonable and feasible low carbon operation management indicator system, and comprehensively evaluate the information related to low carbon operation of SMEs through reasonable selection of indicators. According to the connotation of low-carbon enterprises, the economic benefits of enterprises are closely combined with environmental benefits. A set of low carbon operation performance evaluation index system including economy, technology and environment has been constructed. The AHP index weight is calculated by establishing the AHP model and the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) index weight is calculated by establishing the DEA model. On this basis, the grey relational evaluation model based on AHP-DEA is established. Then the paper evaluates the performance of representative enterprises’ low carbon operation. Propose corresponding improvement suggestions for the problems reflected in the low carbon operation performance ranking of enterprises and the scoring of various indicators. The research results show that the algorithm has high efficiency and the accuracy of model evaluation is 95.51%.

On the other hand, the communication of responsibility and commitment initiatives with citizens is an important factor in achieving social legitimacy for the company. Moreover, digital communication tools, including corporate podcast, are powerful allies for disseminating a corporate brand message aligned with sustainability, commitment and social responsibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to analyze how the banking sector uses corporate podcast as a tool for communicating content related to the SDGs. Methodology: A content analysis of the headlines and explanatory texts of the podcast deliveries issued by the largest financial institutions in Spain during the year 2022 was carried out.

The creation and development of activities, projects, and companies aware of their impact on the planet in the short, medium, and long term, generate much more value when this leadership comes from a female entrepreneurial vocation, by enriching and optimizing the value of diversity in the management of resources, traditionally directed by the male ecosystem. Methodology: a methodological triangulation is applied through in-depth interviews with international key informants, analysis of digital contents in the regions of Andalusia (Spain) and Aveiro (Portugal), and the review of previous scientific literature. Results: The new Spanish-Portuguese startups are still mostly led by men, while the share of female entrepreneurial leadership represents 26.5% of the total sample. Discussion: although there is a wide range for improvement in presence and communication, women are increasing their entrepreneurial and innovative activity. In any case, co-responsibility with the community and care for the environmental legacy are still latent values for professional differentiation. Conclusions: The research highlights current international objective data on entrepreneurial corporate digital communication, providing a complete picture of the reality of women who are committing to business models whose mission, vision, and values are focused on sustainability.","Communication; Csr; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Leadership; Stakeholders; Sustainability","","Funding text 1: Study supported by the Margarita Salas Recualification Grant from the Spanish Ministry of Universities and the European Union -NextGeneration EU for the period 2022-24.

Today, there is an opportunity to leverage ICTs to address sustainability issues head-on through digital marketing and other business activities that go beyond traditional corporate social responsibility (CSR). Across four studies, we instigated how mobile promotions administered via retail loyalty programs impacted the consumption of sustainable products. Multi-level mixed-effect Tobit regression models were used. Data were included for weekly purchases of 21 brands of plant-based beverages made across 242 stores located in Quebec, Canada between 2015 and 2016. Overall, mobile promotions had a positive direct impact on demand (B=0.232, p<0.0001) but increased their price sensitivity (B=-0.898, p<0.0001). Mobile promotions that awarded loyalty points were the most effective at generating demand directly. Advertisements with everyday low pricing increased price sensitivities the most (B=-0.702, p<0.0001).

Particularly data privacy and security risks remain central for consumers. In this evolving setting, the concept of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) gains traction. CDR provides a framework for the responsible application of digital technologies, thereby putting, inter alia, data privacy and security in a larger context. A remarkable amount of prior Information Systems (IS) research can be linked to facets of the concept of CDR. Hence, this study pursues the goal to evaluate the comprehensiveness of current research in IS, also guiding future research efforts. To address this goal, this study grounds on a scoping review to evaluate previous popularity in IS research. The results illustrate a need for a more comprehensive view on data privacy and security in the larger context of CDR in the IS discipline.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Information Systems; Scoping Review; Clock And Data Recovery Circuits (cdr Circuits); Data Privacy; Information Use; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporates; Data Privacy And Securities; Digital Technologies; Information System Research; Prior Information; Privacy Risks; Professional Life; Scoping Review; Security Risks; Information Systems","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Data privacy; Information use; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporates; Data privacy and securities; Digital technologies; Information system research; Prior information; Privacy risks; Professional life; Scoping review; Security risks; Information systems","","Anderson, Chad, Information Security Control Theory: Achieving a Sustainable Reconciliation Between Sharing and Protecting the Privacy of Information, Journal of Management Information Systems, 34, 4, pp. 1082-1112, (2017); Adman, Peter, Participatory sociotechnical design of organizations and information systems - an adaptation of ETHICS methodology, Journal of Information Technology, 15, 1, pp. 39-51, (2000); MIS Quarterly, (2021); Beath, Cynthia Mathis, The contradictory structure of systems development methodologies: Deconstructing the is-user relationship in Information Engineering, Information Systems Research, 5, 4, pp. 350-377, (1994); Journal of Business Economics, (2023); Costello, Gabriel J., The diffusion of WOZ: Expanding the topology of IS innovations, Journal of Information Technology, 22, 1, pp. 79-86, (2007); Chanson, Mathieu, Blockchain for the IoT: Privacy-preserving protection of sensor data, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 20, 9, pp. 1271-1307, (2019); Clemons, Eric K., An empirical investigation of third-party seller rating systems in E-Commerce: The case of buySAFE, Journal of Management Information Systems, 24, 2, pp. 43-71, (2007); Choudhury, Vivek, Information specificity and environmental scanning: An economic perspective, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 21, 1, pp. 25-50, (1997); Culnan, Mary J., How did they get my name?"": An exploratory investigation of consumer attitudes toward secondary information use, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 17, 3, pp. 341-361, (1993)","Klein, M.; Krupka, D.; Winter, C.; Wohlgemuth, V.","Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)","29447682; 16175468","9783885797432; 9783885792956; 3885793458; 9783885797098; 9783885792543; 3885793644; 9783885792222; 9783885796053; 9783885792574; 9783885796985","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181099896"

The present research aims to outline the clients’ perspective on digital banking adoption in Romania, considering its mediating role in the relationship between bank’s social and financial performance. The methodology was based on a mixed method approach, starting with a qualitative analysis of the banks’ CSR reporting and a coding process using the MAXQDA software. We used focus groups to investigate the client’s perceptions in pre-pandemic period, while for the clients’ perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic the data was collected from 774 valid questionnaires. The results indicated a different focus on CSR dimensions before and during the pandemic, from a People-oriented approach to a more Profit-oriented one, suggesting that the use of digital banking was influenced by the ease of use, CSR disclosure and COVID-19 pandemic.","Banking; Clients; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Banking; Romania","","5Costin Octavian Sorici, PhD, is Lecturer and he has an extensive experience as scholar and entrepreneur in the fields of Education and Business Consulting.

The study involved 276 participants from a university’s business administration department, undergoing an international business course. A range of technology-based activities incorporating MI strategies was employed, exploring key topics such as globalization, corporate social responsibility, and market segmentation. Hypothesis testing revealed that high expectations and changes in viewpoints positively impacted self-concept, ability, and motivation, contributing to improved learning outcomes. The integration of technology in teaching facilitated these transformations, demonstrating how digital tools like virtual reality, interactive platforms, and online tutorials can enhance learning experiences. However, the effect on learning gain varied when viewpoints changed, indicating a need for further research into the differential impact of technology on learning outcomes. Despite some limitations, the study offers compelling evidence supporting the integration of MIs teaching strategy with technology-enriched environments in business administration education.

These changes increasingly involve the processing of personal data into information and knowledge that can be used to create individualised user experiences or gain insights from aggregated data. Customer relationships and the interconnectedness of customers are similarly changing as a result of this digital transformation. As customers become more demanding and involved, voluntary activities that go beyond compliance and regulation are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, companies are increasingly recognising the potential of privacy-friendly goods and services. They are using the heterogeneity of their offerings to develop unique selling propositions that focus on fulfilling their digital responsibilities (e.g., Apple, Samsung). In this way, digital responsibility fosters innovation in goods, services and digital markets. The voluntary responsibility of companies in dealing with digital technologies and creating value from data is discussed under the term 'corporate digital responsibility' (CDR). This young field of research has its origins in the study of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and is often discussed in that context. However, with the growing importance of digital responsibility for organisations and the proliferation of related activities, it is increasingly establishing itself as a discipline in its own right. Correspondingly, research on CDR has also seen a sharp increase in the number of publications since 2019. The paper evaluates existing research approaches in a systematic literature review. It highlights definitional approaches, approaches to describing the entrepreneurial motivation for CDR activities and their consequences for corporations, their business relationships and society. Further, the paper identifies research gaps of CDR and provides a basis for further research. This paper shall also serve as a starting point for organisations to establish their own efforts in this area, as well as for the evaluation of existing activities.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Data Ethics; Data Protection; Digital Ethics; Digital Transformation; Data Handling; Metadata; Petroleum Reservoir Evaluation; Philosophical Aspects; Sales; Social Aspects; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Responsibility; Corporates; Data Ethic; Digital Ethics; Digital Innovations; Digital Transformation; Economy And Society; Systematic Review; Value Creation Process; Public Relations","Data handling; Metadata; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Philosophical aspects; Sales; Social aspects; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporate responsibility; Corporates; Data ethic; Digital ethics; Digital innovations; Digital transformation; Economy and society; Systematic Review; Value creation process; Public relations","","Ashok, Mona, Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and Digital technologies, International Journal of Information Management, 62, (2022); Bednárová, Michaela, Corporate digital responsibility: bibliometric landscape – chronological literature review, International Journal of Digital Accounting Research, 23, (2023); Corporate Digital Responsibility, (2021); Carl, Kim Valerie, A consumer perspective on Corporate Digital Responsibility: an empirical evaluation of consumer preferences, Journal of Business Economics, 94, 7-8, pp. 979-1024, (2024); Carl, Kim Valerie, Corporate Digital Responsibility and the current Corporate Social Responsibility standard: An analysis of applicability, Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI), P-325, pp. 75-86, (2022); Corporate Digital Responsibility Survey 2022, (2022); Corporate Digital Responsibility, (2021); Cheng, Cong, Conceptualizing Corporate Digital Responsibility: A Digital Technology Development Perspective, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023); Csr News, (2018); Global Intelligence for Digital Leaders, (2017)","Moreira, F.; Moreira, F.; Jayantilal, S.","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","20491050","9781912764341; 9781911218555; 9781914587153; 9781917204149; 9781911218975; 9781914587863; 9781914587481; 9781910810491; 9781914587825; 9781914587108","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178129896"

Despite the escalating organizational interest in investing in technological advancements, the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry lags in the digitalization race. This research aims to introduce a conceptual framework for businesses to succeed in digital transformation and maintain competitive operations through digitalization. The Digital Transformation Framework was applied in an O&G company based in Brazil, focused on the Subsea segment, and is built upon three key pillars. First, defining the digital's identity for the company, the materialization in a long-term strategy, and leadership sponsorship. Second, establishing partnerships with IT and Finance departments, and suppliers, the project management and execution engine layer is a channel to collect ideas, workflow for implementation, and follow-up meetings. The third pillar is related to people, which embraces a strong communication plan, the volunteer work of digital agents, the empowerment of employees as developers, and an upskilling program to increase competencies. The implementation of the framework has successfully increased the digital maturity of the organization and facilitated a sustainable cultural transformation. The framework enabled the generation of improvement ideas, led the automation of critical processes, and enhanced data management. Also, empowered employees to deliver developments independently, and these individuals have been designated as citizen developers. Moreover, the Digital Agents' role promoted a vital contribution to cultural formation. Their influence and support in major areas have elevated the digital culture, promoting the team's involvement and delivering projects autonomously. Likewise, a training program based on digital awareness following an upskilling plan and linked to business strategy allowed the implementation of new technologies in daily operations. Also, incentive mechanisms were established based on financial recognition, increasing employee visibility to those aligned with the corporate strategy and promoting cultural development. Finally, the partnership with technical developers and suppliers was strengthened, including academia for specialized and high-technological projects. The Digital Transformation Framework fosters innovation and provides a practical digitalization approach that tailors its applicability to an O&G industry, defining processes, responsibilities, and stakeholders’ collaboration. This case study presents valuable insights regarding feasible implications for companies that embarked on their digital transformation journey and those seeking to navigate the digital landscape.","Gas Industry; Information Management; Offshore Oil Well Production; Offshore Technology; Personnel Training; Conceptual Frameworks; Digital Identity; Digital Transformation; Industrial Sector; Long-term Strategy; Oil And Gas Companies; Oil And Gas Industry; Organizational Interests; Technological Advancement; Transformation Process; Project Management","Gas industry; Information management; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Personnel training; Conceptual frameworks; Digital identity; Digital transformation; Industrial sector; Long-term strategy; Oil and gas companies; Oil and Gas Industry; Organizational interests; Technological advancement; Transformation process; Project management","The authors would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to Aker Solutions for the opportunity to share our findings with a broader community.

While social media brings people together globally and creates new spaces for creativity and resistance, it is also a space of harassment, discrimination, and violence. As recent debates about hate speech and the distribution of “fake news” have shown, the political responsibilities and consequences of regulating online content remain unclear. More recently, the EU is increasingly paying attention to platform providers. How is the EU legitimizing its new approach to social media platform regulation and how will this legislation shape transnational publics? This article contributes to ongoing debates on platform regulation by governments and other political authorities (especially the EU as a transnational legislator) and discussions about the shape of online publics. By applying a discourse analytical perspective, key legitimation narratives can be explored. I argue that the EU claims political authority over corporate interests by introducing new legislation to regulate social media platforms with the Digital Services Act. On the one hand, the EU imagines an idealized democratic online public without harmful and illegal content. On the other hand, the new legislation serves the EU’s agenda on digital sovereignty, taking back control from big and US-based enterprises. There is a strong consensus about four legitimation narratives: (a) “What is illegal offline has to be illegal online”; (b) the EU is “taking back control”; (c) the EU is “protecting small businesses, consumers, and our citizens against big tech”; (d) the EU is developing “a golden standard and rulebook beyond the EU.” Held together by the idea of democratic procedures, authority, and sovereignty, these narratives are demanding more action from social media providers to act on harmful and illegal content.","Content Moderation; Digital Services Act; Eu Regulation; Freedom Of Expression; Social Media Platforms","","I am very thankful for constructive critique and support-ive comments by the anonymous reviewers, the editors of this thematic issue, the participants in the joint online workshop “Global Publics,” organized by Jane Mende and Thomas Müller, as well as Jaakko Heiskanen who dis-cussed a draft of this article at the ISA Conference 2023 in Montreal.","Algorithmic Reason the New Government of Self and Other, (2022); Argomaniz, Javier, European Union responses to terrorist use of the Internet, Cooperation and Conflict, 50, 2, pp. 250-268, (2015); Online Hate Speech in the European Union A Discourse Analytic Perspective, (2017); Beer, David, The social power of algorithms, Information Communication and Society, 20, 1, pp. 1-13, (2017); Bellanova, Rocco, Digital, politics, and algorithms: Governing digital data through the lens of data protection, European Journal of Social Theory, 20, 3, pp. 329-347, (2017); Bellanova, Rocco, Digital/sovereignty and European security integration: an introduction, European Security, 31, 3, pp. 337-355, (2022); Zeitschrift Fur Politikwissenschaft, (2020); Digital Technology and Democratic Theory, (2021); Carr, Madeline, Power plays in global internet governance, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 43, 2, pp. 640-659, (2015); Castells, Manuel, The new public sphere: Global civil Society, communication networks, and global governance, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 616, 1, pp. 78-93, (2008)","","Cogitatio Press","21832463","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170057018"

In-depth interviews are used for data collection to develop the framework while focus group discussions are used for validation. The in-depth interviews are carried out with various stakeholders, such as the government, association, MSMEs, suppliers, and banking. Findings show that blockchain technology as corporate governance innovation framework has the potential to reduce asymmetric information and credit risk. The reason is that blockchain technology can facilitate recording, immutable, partial decentralisation, and storage of business and financial transactions on a digital network and all stakeholders can access information in a transparent and valid manner that can increase transparency, accountability, responsibility, and fairness. Results of the focus group discussion indicate the validity of the proposed framework.","Blockchain Technology; Corporate Governance Innovation; Credit Risk","","Funding text 1: The authors thank the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia for the research funding 2022.

However, little is said about what this means when the state becomes a user of the same platform from which it retreats as a regulator—and more importantly relies on its user capacity to configure and repress public opinion. This article asks how we go about contextualizing the evolving nature of state violation of rights and freedoms on social media platforms and the state’s dereliction of duty? It argues that the changing dynamic represents a process by which power reproduces itself by linking state and corporate interests to the detriment of the people.

However, determining what key social responsibility information to make available is challenging for firms. In terms of green product transactions online, whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) transparency affects online green purchase willingness remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of CSR information transparency on the online consumption of green agricultural products. Data were collected from a sample of 562 Chinese online consumers and the structural equation modelling method was used. The results show that both dimensions of CSR transparency had a positive effect on consumers’ online identification and online green purchase willingness. In addition, consumers’ online identification positively affected their online green purchase willingness.

This is why the current article investigates the effect of DT and the firm’s innovation performance and the boundary condition of corporate social responsibility (CRS). Method: This study proposed a conceptual research model for the effect of DT on innovation performance and discussed the boundary condition of CRS. We collected China’s listed A-share firms’ data to examine the proposed hypotheses statistically. After Hausman test, the current study adopted fixed-effect regression, examined the heterogeneity issues resulting from different industry classifications, and robustness test for the correctness of the results. Results and Implications: The following main conclusions are drawn: 1) DT can significantly enhance product innovation performance; 2) DT can significantly improve process innovation performance; 3) There is a time lag effect on the innovation performance (both product and process innovation performance) of the previous period on the innovation performance of the current period; 4) CSR positively moderates the role of DT on innovation performance; and 5) The impact of DT is heterogeneous across industries and patent. This study not only enriched the literature on DT and innovation performance but also provided the guidelines to promote digital transformation at the firm level.","Csr; Digital Transformation (dt); Innovation Performance; Process Innovation Performance; Product Innovation Performance","","","Gupta, Abhinav, Red, blue, and purple firms: Organizational political ideology and corporate social responsibility, Strategic Management Journal, 38, 5, pp. 1018-1040, (2017); Acemoglu, Daron, Market size in innovation: Theory and evidence from the pharmaceutical industry, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 3, pp. 1049-1090, (2004); Ahuja, Gautam, Where do resources come from?

More efforts are being made to improve the separate collection of waste directly from households and to promote recycling, but on the other hand, waste companies are under heavy pressure to keep waste management costs moderate to the customers and limit the environmental impacts of waste management. Carbon neutrality has become a competitive and reputational factor and an essential aspect of corporate responsibility, and therefore companies are setting ambitious targets to become carbon neutral in the future. Still, in the waste management sector, monitoring or mitigating the carbon footprint of waste transportation is not a common practice. Yet, optimizing logistic operations by intelligent monitoring can provide remarkable possibilities to reduce emissions and save fuel consumption and waste management costs. This case study analyzes the implementation of carbon neutrality as a part of CSR in a regional waste transport company. The waste bin level measurement results from one household company are utilized to demonstrate the effects of digital monitoring. The results summarize active measures that companies can take to reduce waste transport emissions and costs. Companies can switch to lower-emission vehicles, optimize logistics, add multi-compartment vehicles, and develop marketing and reporting. In this case, digitalization has been used to renew the operational business model and to provide new innovative data-based waste management. Intelligent remote monitoring in waste container infra has changed logistics planning and a digital marketplace has made the climate and economic benefits of databased waste collection visible to the customers. This research concludes that digitalization will change waste management and that carbon neutrality will likely become a differentiator for waste sector organizations, allowing them to gain competitive and reputational advantage.","Carbon Emissions; Csr; Digitalization; Waste Logistics","","This paper was elaborated with the support of a grant of the funding programme KareliaCBC, project REMAC-Renewing Sludge Management practices in Karelia and Kainuu, number Ka11000.","Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Europes Heavy Duty Vehicles, (2020); Waste Framework Directive, (2022); Transport Emissions, (2022); Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Transport, (2018); Municipal Waste Statistics, (2019); Guzdek, Sylwia, Economic and ecological assessment of transport of various types of waste, Inzynieria Ekologiczna, 21, 5, pp. 19-26, (2020); Jouhara, Hussam I., Municipal waste management systems for domestic use, Energy, 139, pp. 485-506, (2017); Primax International Journal of Commerce and Management Research, (2016); Le, Thanhthanh, How do corporate social responsibility and green innovation transform corporate green strategy into sustainable firm performance?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 362, (2022); Li, Zhiwei, Crisp and fuzzy optimization models for sustainable municipal solid waste management, Journal of Cleaner Production, 370, (2022)","","National Society of Environmental Science and Engineering (SNSIM)","23929537; 23929545","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162137210"

Humanity’s ability to connect and transmit across global boundaries, and the data economy that has grown up around that environment, has been so influential that governments worldwide are now struggling with whether to set limits for the extent of social media and social networks that has become so ubiquitous that few people would be capable of imagining their lives without them. At the same time, social media users are learning more about their roles in the data economy. Social and digital marketing provide organizations with considerable opportunities to drive lower costs, increase brand recognition, and boost sales. Recognizing the influence that Internet content has on consumers attitudes and decisions, brands have begun approaching social media influencers (i.e., powerful users of social media who have managed to generate large audiences of followers) and offering incentives for social media influencers (i.e., creating and sharing content related to the relevant, authentically-appearing brand, a practice known as influencer marketing). We determine long-run platform effects for both direct and spillover communication, by dividing the estimates for direct and spillover communications by the decline in intermedia engagement. We determine consumer engagement with brand activity on the Internet-based resources. Due to log–log specifications, estimates also reflect elasticities between the brand-generated content and the consumers engagement. Once the brand’s goal is decided, the team must talk with employees, partners, and customers to understand the employee’s interests in the social causes. Our results show that strengthening stakeholders’ relationships with the company by conducting a reciprocal corporate social responsibility initiative can be beneficial. Social impact by consumers engagement with network-based and small-group-based virtual communities can also be useful.","Consumer Behavior; Economic Theory; Internet Regulation","","Acknowledgements The research is carried out with the financial support of the Kuban Scientific Foundation within the framework of the scientific project No. PPN-21.1/51 “Mechanisms and technologies to counteract the influence of the content of Internet resources and social networks on the national consciousness of young people”.","Aho, Brett, Beyond surveillance capitalism: Privacy, regulation and big data in Europe and China, Economy and Society, 49, 2, pp. 187-212, (2020); Aikin, Kathryn J., Individual- and Ad-Level Predictors of Perceptions of Serious and Actionable Risks in Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug TV Advertising, Journal of Health Communication, 24, 5, pp. 536-546, (2019); Ancillai, Chiara, Advancing social media driven sales research: Establishing conceptual foundations for B-to-B social selling, Industrial Marketing Management, 82, pp. 293-308, (2019); Argyris, Young Anna, The effects of visual congruence on increasing consumers’ brand engagement: An empirical investigation of influencer marketing on instagram using deep-learning algorithms for automatic image classification, Computers in Human Behavior, 112, (2020); Bharucha, Jehangir Pheroze, Social media and young consumers behavior, International Journal of Supply Chain Management, 7, 6, pp. 72-81, (2018); Brinson, Nancy Howell, Reactance and turbulence: examining the cognitive and affective antecedents of ad blocking, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 15, 4, pp. 549-570, (2021); Čábelková, Inna, Customer store loyalty determinants: A case of the czech republic, DLSU Business and Economics Review, 25, 1, pp. 28-44, (2015); Čábelková, Inna, The social acceptance of nuclear fusion for decision making towards carbon free circular economy: Evidence from Czech Republic, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); Dodel, Matias, Inequality in digital skills and the adoption of online safety behaviors, Information Communication and Society, 21, 5, pp. 712-728, (2018); Dolan, Rebecca M., Social media engagement behavior: A framework for engaging customers through social media content, European Journal of Marketing, 53, 10, pp. 2213-2243, (2019)","Kumar, V.; Kuzmin, E.; Zhang, W.; Lavrikova, Y.","Springer Nature","21987254; 21987246","9783031900532; 9783319338637; 9783031766572; 9783030552763; 9783030305482; 9783031065804; 9783031261206; 9783030506759; 9789811678172; 9783031290190","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161633487"

Even though the reviewed literature does not give insights into the conditions and implementation processes underlying such positive effect, it highlights the key factors that could positively link digital transformation and the development of corporate social responsibility strategies. These results appear useful both for business practice and future research.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Sustainable Development Strategy","","","","Dal Zotto, C.; Omidi, A.; Aoun, G.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","21954968; 21954976","9783030342685; 9783319620503; 9783031303500; 9783030496432; 9783030475383; 9783030732608; 9783031157691; 9783030439927; 9783031801211; 9783031324352","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161386124"

To achieve this purpose, negative stereotypes about old age and disability must be eliminated, and the multiple barriers of exclusion that hinder participation by citizen groups affected by such stigmas need to be dismantled as well. Along these lines, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have promoted regulatory frameworks and corporate initiatives aimed at the integration of the most vulnerable audiences. However, consensus is not always achieved among the private sector, the institutional domain, and citizens in the labour of developing a comprehensive strategy that could lead to the desired condition of full inclusion. Technological innovation and digitisation seem to play a decisive role on the road toward social integration of seniors and people with disabilities, although these social groups are often especially affected by the digital gap that exacerbates their inequality and further limits their sociopolitical participation. This monograph seeks to promote greater knowledge of the different strategic aspects that could enable companies, institutions, and administrative bodies to make further progress toward policies aimed at the complete integration of vulnerable adults in the digital era. Therefore, this work aims to contribute to the design and implementation of comprehensive models that use technology to improve the conditions of these segments of the population from the point of view of a win-win situation.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Inclusion; Older People; People With Disabilities; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Vulnerable Adults","","Funding text 1: This research is part of the project entitled, \""Disability and Digital Skills in the Audio-Visual Sector - COMPENSA\"" (Ref.

In this study, we examine the effects of digital technologies on CSR based on listed firms in China’s stock markets from 2009 to 2019. We find that digital transformation significantly promotes CSR. This result is unchanged when we further introduce an exogenous shock, China’s 4 G-LTE policy, to identify the causality. Mechanistical analysis shows that digital technology helps companies improve pollution control capabilities and internal control efficiency, thereby improving CSR performance. Cross-sectionally, the above promotion effect is more significant in firms with low financing constraints and greater regulatory pressure.

Concerns have been raised about loot boxes' similarities with gambling and their potential harms (e.g. overspending). Recognizing players' and parents' concerns, in mid-2020, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) announced that games containing loot boxes or any forms of in-game transactions with randomized elements will be marked by a new label stating 'In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)'. The same label has also been adopted by the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) and thereby assigned to games available on digital storefronts, e.g. the Google Play Store. The label is intended to provide more information to consumers and allow them to make more informed purchasing decisions. This measure is not legally binding and has been adopted as industry self-regulation or corporate social responsibility. Previous research has suggested that industry self-regulation might not be effectively complied with due to conflicting commercial interests. Compliance with the ESRB's, PEGI's and IARC's loot box presence warning label was assessed in two studies. The first study found that 60.6% of all games labelled by either the ESRB or PEGI (or 16.1% using a more equitable methodology) were not labelled by the other. The majority of the inconsistencies were caused by the ESRB refusing to apply the measure retroactively. Five instances where one age rating organization culpably failed to accurately identify loot box presence were identified (although only two cases were admitted by the relevant organization). Generally, with newly released games, consumers can rely on the PEGI and ESRB labels. PEGI has retroactively labelled many older games, meaning that consumers can expect the labelling to be accurate. However, due to the ESRB's policies (which it has refused to improve), North American consumers cannot rely on the label for many older games containing loot boxes, unlike their European counterparts. The data suggest that the loot box issue is far more pressing on mobile platforms than console/PC platforms. The second study found that 71.0% of popular games containing loot boxes on the Google Play Store (whose age rating system is regulated through IARC) did not display the label and were therefore non-compliant. The IARC's current policy on the Google Play Store is that only games submitted for rating after February 2022 are required to be labelled. This policy (which the IARC has refused to improve) means that most popular and high-grossing games can be, and presently are, marketed without the label, thus significantly reducing the measure's scope and potential benefit. The Apple App Store still does not allow loot box presence to be disclosed. At present, consumers and parents cannot rely on this self-regulatory measure to provide accurate information as to loot box presence for mobile games. Due to their immense scale, the mobile markets pose regulatory and enforcement challenges that PEGI admits are not yet resolved. The mere existence of this measure cannot be used to justify the non-regulation of loot boxes by governments, given the poor compliance and doubtful efficacy (even if when complied with satisfactorily). Improvements to the existing age rating systems are proposed.

Nowadays, category management is perceived by most organisations as a continuous business process where category management activities are an integral part of the business. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study was the conceptual principles and methodological approaches to the management of product categories, which are highlighted by Ukrainian and foreign researchers, in the materials of periodicals, and in the Internet resources dedicated to the investigation of classical and modern concepts of category management. In the process of their development, such scientific and empirical methods as causal analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction, systematisation and generalisation, system and process approaches were used. The conducted research revealed the presence of significant reserves for the development of category management at industrial enterprises. According to the results of “The Future of Category Management” survey, such global macro trends of the transformation of category management were identified as the store of the future; digital supply system; the future of the food market; the growing role of environmental, social, and corporate responsibility. An approach to assessing the state of category management at a trade and industry enterprise is proposed, with the help of checklists for monitoring the state of provision of category management and monitoring the assessment of the organisational effect in the field of enterprise category management. The proposed approach to assessing the state of category management will contribute to the improvement of approaches to planning, information, and analytical support and control over the main management processes at the enterprise.","Brand; Category Management; Industry; Management; Retail; Social Responsibility; Trade","","","Basuroy, Suman, The impact of category management on retailer prices and performance: Theory and evidence, Journal of Marketing, 65, 4, pp. 16-32, (2001); Brubakken, Adam J., Contractual procurement alternatives of air force contingency pharmaceuticals: a cost-benefit analysis, Journal of Defense Analytics and Logistics, 4, 2, pp. 111-128, (2020); Cadeaux, Jack M., Performance effects of category assortment and stock allocation decisions for a cash-and-carry wholesaler, International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 23, 5, pp. 537-552, (2013); Dandage, Rahul V., Strategy development using TOWS matrix for international project risk management based on prioritization of risk categories, International Journal of Managing Projects in Business, 12, 4, pp. 1003-1029, (2019); Goic, Marcel, Detecting inefficiently managed categories in a retail store, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 66, 1, pp. 160-171, (2015); Hall, Joseph M., Retailer Dynamic Pricing and Ordering Decisions: Category Management versus Brand-by-Brand Approaches, Journal of Retailing, 86, 2, pp. 172-183, (2010); Heikkilä, Jussi, Purchasing category management: Providing integration between purchasing and other business functions, International Journal of Procurement Management, 11, 5, pp. 533-550, (2018); Holweg, Christina, The drivers of consumer value in the ECR Category Management model, International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 19, 3, pp. 199-218, (2009); Business Inform, (2021); Hrynko, Pavlo, Formation of an Innovative Business Model of a Trade Organization in the Context of Economic Globalization, Scientific Horizons, 24, 6, pp. 92-98, (2021)","","Polissia National University","26632144; 27098877","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151307419"

China’s social and economic sectors have begun to integrate and develop in-depth with digital technology. Whether the digitalization of enterprises can drive their green innovation is an urgent question to be explored. The aim of our study is to answer this question and investigate whether digitalization has finally affected corporate green innovation. On the basis of theoretical discussion, the data of 3,547 Chinese listed companies from 2014 to 2019 were selected as samples. The fixed effect model was used to empirically test the relationship between digitization and green innovation, and then the intermediary effect model was used to analyze the influence mechanism. Research has found that digitalization is genuinely driving green innovation in business. After the robustness test, the conclusion remains the same. In order to deepen the understanding of the impact of digitalization on the green innovation of enterprises, this study additionally analyzed the impact mechanism. We find that digitization can promote corporate green innovation by easing corporate financing constraints and enhancing corporate awareness of fulfilling social responsibility. Moreover, we also find that the impact of digitalization on firm performance is more obvious in the samples with high level of internal control, state-owned enterprises and senior executives with IT background. The findings of this study enrich the related theories of digitalization and sustainability and provide empirical evidence for the positive externalities of digitalization.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Financing Constraints; Green Innovation; Internal Control Level","","YF: software, validation, investigation, data curation, manuscript revision financial support; QS: validation, investigation; supervision; financial support, manuscript revision XW: Conceptualization, funding acquisition and writing and horbar; original draft.

Although digitalisation has led to a significant increase in efficiency, it raises certain concerns related to privacy, data protection and other human rights, which might be at stake when huge amounts of data are being collected and processed or when AI is used for decision making. Digitalisation, apart from increasing efficiency, has a strong potential to contribute to sustainable development if responsibility and trust are guaranteed. Therefore, companies should critically reflect upon different ethical criteria to avoid compromising democratic rights and values when engaging in digitalisation.

But the emerged “greenwashing” problem has also brought haze to the value creation of capital market. To study the consequences of the pseudo-social responsibility behavior of “greenwashing”, this paper takes China’s listed companies as the research sample to empirically examine the relationship between sustainability reporting “greenwashing” and “shared value” creation. It is found that the “greenwashing” behavior of corporate sustainability reporting significantly reduces the “shared value” creation, while the degree of sustainability information asymmetry and the quality of information disclosure play a partial mediation role between them. Further analysis shows that the more effective internal control of a company and the greater pressure of external media supervision, the more conducive to weaken the negative impact of “greenwashing” on “shared value” creation. This paper enriches the literature on the economic consequences of “greenwashing” in sustainability disclosure and the influencing factors of “shared value” creation, extends the research on information disclosure and “shared value” from financial information to non-financial information. The results call for the state to promote legislative work, formulate unified standards and compress the “greenwashing” gray space; Governments could implement mandatory disclosure, implement independent authentication and strengthen “greenwashing” social supervision; Companies should strengthen capacity building and improve the “greenwashing” governance mechanism with the help of digital empowerment.","Article; China; Data Quality; Economic Parameters; Economic Well-being; Empirical Research; Financial Information System; Greenwashing; Human; Industry; Information Asymmetry; Information Dissemination; Information Processing; Interpersonal Communication; Mediation Analysis; Program Sustainability; Quality Control; Shared Value; Social Problem; Social Responsibility; Socioeconomics; Government; Organization; Social Behavior; Disclosure; Government; Organizations; Social Behavior; Social Responsibility","Article; China; data quality; economic parameters; economic well-being; empirical research; financial information system; greenwashing; human; industry; information asymmetry; information dissemination; information processing; interpersonal communication; mediation analysis; program sustainability; quality control; shared value; social problem; social responsibility; socioeconomics; government; organization; social behavior; Disclosure; Government; Organizations; Social Behavior; Social Responsibility","The study was funded through the National Statistical Science Research Program Project (2021LY081) and Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(2022HZ1516).

Healthcare providers especially have made social responsibility their goal. However, crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted different activities within the healthcare sector including CSR and its monitoring. However, theory-driven CSR research within the healthcare sector is scarce and monitoring requires a structured understanding of the processes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the CSR practices and activities which healthcare providers have implemented in an exemplified country namely Germany and the effect of the pandemic in this process. (2) Methods: Participants were sampled based on their field of care (general, psychiatric, or rehabilitation), the type of organization (public, private, or non-profit), and group membership. A total of 18 healthcare providers were initially recruited, out of which nine participated in the interviews. They represent companies with yearly revenue of between EUR 110 million and EUR 6 billion, and have between 900 and 73,000 employees. (3) Results: CSR-related activities were postponed due to times of crisis. There was a necessity to rapidly digitalize processes. Frequent and precise communication turned out to be important for keeping employees’ well-being, motivation, and satisfaction levels high. Environmental efforts were counteracted by new hygienic requirements and a shift in priorities. Many study participants expressed the hope that after the pandemic, newly established methods, processes, and structures (e.g., digital meetings, quicker and more inclusive communication) would be maintained and developed further. (4) Conclusions: The pandemic has been challenging and at the same time, these challenges also created opportunities to strike a new path using the learnings to overcome future health-related or economic crises.","Corporate Social Performance; Covid-19; Crisis Communication; Crisis Management; Csr; Experience; Healthcare Professionals; Leadership; Organization; Strategic Management; Corporate Social Responsibility; Covid-19; Crisis Management; Health Services; Health Worker; Hygiene; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Corporate Organization; Digitalization; Economic Crisis; Environmental Factor; Germany; Health Care Personnel; Health Personnel Attitude; Human; Interpersonal Communication; Interview; Mental Health Care; Motivation; Non Profit Organization; Pandemic; Personal Hygiene; Private Sector; Public Sector; Rehabilitation Care; Satisfaction; Social Responsibility; Videoconferencing; Wellbeing; Epidemiology; Organization; Communication; Humans; Organizations; Pandemics; Social Responsibility","corporate social responsibility; COVID-19; crisis management; health services; health worker; hygiene; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; corporate organization; digitalization; economic crisis; environmental factor; Germany; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; interpersonal communication; interview; mental health care; motivation; non profit organization; pandemic; personal hygiene; private sector; public sector; rehabilitation care; satisfaction; social responsibility; videoconferencing; wellbeing; epidemiology; organization; Communication; Humans; Organizations; Pandemics; Social Responsibility","This research was partially funded by the Innovation Fund of the German Joint Government Committee (G-BA) Funding No: 01VSF18023.","Dyllick, Thomas H., Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability, Business Strategy and the Environment, 11, 2, pp. 130-141, (2002); Cannibals with Forks the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business, (1997); Albinger, Heather Schmidt, Corporate social performance and attractiveness as an employer to different job seeking populations, Journal of Business Ethics, 28, 3, pp. 243-253, (2000); Buhmann, Karin, Public Regulators and CSR: The ‘Social Licence to Operate’ in Recent United Nations Instruments on Business and Human Rights and the Juridification of CSR, Journal of Business Ethics, 136, 4, pp. 699-714, (2016); Carroll, Archie B., The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders, Business Horizons, 34, 4, pp. 39-48, (1991); Schwartz, Mark S., Corporate social responsibility: A three-domain approach, Business Ethics Quarterly, 13, 4, pp. 503-598, (2003); Quazi, Ali M., An empirical test of a cross-national model of corporate social responsibility, Journal of Business Ethics, 25, 1, pp. 33-51, (2000); Crifo, Patricia, The economics of corporate social responsibility: A firm-level perspective survey, Journal of Economic Surveys, 29, 1, pp. 112-130, (2015); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate social responsibility: The centerpiece of competing and complementary frameworks, Organizational Dynamics, 44, 2, pp. 87-96, (2015); Vlachos, Pavlos A., Corporate social responsibility: Attributions, loyalty, and the mediating role of trust, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 37, 2, pp. 170-180, (2009)","","MDPI","16604601; 16617827","","","36612690","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145975860"

This study uses the data of listed companies in China’s heavily polluting industries from 2012 to 2020 and Baidu Index data to analyze how public environmental concerns affect the digital transformation of heavily polluting enterprises. This study finds that public environmental concerns can significantly promote the digital transformation of heavily polluting enterprises. For non-state-owned, green image and high-tech enterprises, the impact is even more obvious.

We applied a mixed research methodology: a comparative content analysis of qualitative and quantitative indicators, as well as in-depth interviews with 10 professionals and experts in fashion and digital communication, with the aim of contrasting their opinions with the results of the study. The five sustainable fashion brands (YosoLOVEamor, LIFEGIST, ECOALF, Alohas, and ECOOLOGY) chosen are distinguished by the fact that they base their business projects on social and environmental responsibility, and their Instagram accounts were studied over a period. This paper demonstrates the social interest in and concern for sustainability, ethics, and corporate social responsibility in the fashion industry. Additionally, it is evident that slow fashion brands need to have a good online strategy, as it is the future of fashion.

This study found that financial sharing can reduce the corporate debt cost. The path mechanism test finds that financial sharing reduces the corporate debt cost mainly by improving the quality of corporate accounting information and decreasing financial risk. The result shows that the effect of financial sharing on reducing the corporate debt cost is positively moderated by enterprise digitalization. Further analysis based on the stakeholder perspective shows that the effect of financial shared services on reducing the corporate debt cost is enhanced by the equity balance and social responsibility fulfillment.

Endowed with abundant internal resources and high innovative capacity, these global niche market leaders face regional resource constraints, concerning digital infrastructure and workforce with digital capabilities. 57 semi-structured interviews with firm representatives and regional actors in rural Germany are analyzed. We show that these enterprises strategically use measures of corporate local and regional responsibility and exert place leadership to develop digitalization-related assets in their rural regions. These initiatives are operated through modes of both inclusive and exclusive agency and benefit. We find that the motives for these actions are grounded in a perceived lack of swiftness and capacity of public actors, but also entail emotional attachment to the region, particularly for family businesses. Our findings have implications for regional policymakers, such as targeting greater alignment of regional and corporate development goals.","Corporate Local And Regional Responsibility; Digitalization; Hidden Champions; Place Leadership; Rural Areas; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Industrial Enterprise; Innovation; Policy Making; Rural Area; Germany","corporate social responsibility; digitization; industrial enterprise; innovation; policy making; rural area; Germany","This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) under Grant 2820FD007A.

This law obliges social media platforms to delete unlawful content from their sites and has received international attention as a regulatory blueprint for governing corporate content moderation. The paper describes different ways in which NetzDG was framed in German media reporting, which offered distinct assessments of whether the new law endangered or supported democratic principles and values. Major differences in the public controversy over NetzDG revolved around, for instance, what freedom of expression and the rule of law meant for content moderation and how NetzDG’s regulatory intervention would interact with platforms. The paper finds that a major point of contention thus concerned how to ground content moderation practices and policies in democratic legitimacy. Its analysis demonstrates that the governance of content moderation on social media platforms can open up a site for renegotiating democratic values and principles. As the NetzDG case shows, this can happen without substantively challenging existing laws but by raising the question of how to legitimately apply them to platforms. At stake in this controversy were the underlying logics by which to govern speech online. Different perspectives on this built on distinct understandings of democracy, attributing particular roles and responsibilities to platforms, state institutions, and users. Thus, the paper illuminates that the public controversy over NetzDG, and over the right way to uphold speech laws on platforms, concerned more fundamental questions about the shape of democracy and the distribution of power, agency, and responsibility.","Content Moderation; Digital Democracy; Freedom Of Expression; Internet Governance; Platfrom Regulation","","","undefined, (2017); Bekkers, Victor J.J.M.(Victor), Legitimacy and democracy: A conceptual framework for assessing governance practices, pp. 35-60, (2016); Benson, Rodney, Shaping the public sphere: Habermas and beyond, American Sociologist, 40, 3, pp. 175-197, (2009); undefined, (2018); Bhagwat, Ashutosh, Freedom of Expression and Democracy, pp. 82-105, (2021); Buchanan, Allen E., Political Legitimacy and Democracy, Ethics, 112, 4, pp. 689-719, (2002); Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, (1949); Habermas and the Public Sphere, (1992); Gesetzentwurf Der Bundesregierung Entwurf Eines Gesetzes Zur Verbesserung Der Rechtsdurchsetzung in Sozialen Netzwerken, (2017); Cowls, Josh, Constitutional metaphors: Facebook’s “supreme court” and the legitimation of platform governance, New Media and Society, 26, 5, pp. 2448-2472, (2024)","","Weizenbaum Institute","","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010633703"

Findings: The authors have determined that the previous researches pointed to the existence of the correlation between CDR and DTrust although they did not elaborate on this explicitly. It was shown that the DT itself directly influences trust and sustainability. The indirect influence DT has via CDR was the task the authors undertook through designing a new conceptual model within whose frame the authors separately presented the influence of total CDR on DTrust as well as of the specific CDR dimensions on the particular dimensions of DTrust. Originality/value: The authors tried to offer the conceptual model that exactly determines the relation of individual dimensions of the processed phenomena by analyzing theoretical and empirical researches carried out so far, and eo ipso shed more light on their mutual relation. The authors firmly believe that this paper offers a useful frame for further empirical researches.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Csr; Digital Transformation; Digital Trust; Hpc; Responsible Corporate Digital Governance","","This paper forms part of a special section “The power of High-performance computing infrastructure for small and medium sized enterprises”, guest edited by Nadja Damij, Markus Abel, Bill O’Gorman and Sergio Botelho Junior.","MIT Sloan Manag Rev, (2019); Digital Trust Erase the Trust Paradox in Banking, (2016); Building Digital Trust Technology can Lead the Way, (2019); Aldasoro, Unai, A parallel Branch-and-Fix Coordination based matheuristic algorithm for solving large sized multistage stochastic mixed 0–1 problems, European Journal of Operational Research, 258, 2, pp. 590-606, (2017); Trust and Social Capital in for Good Measure Advancing Research on Well Being Metrics Beyon Gdp, (2018); Corporate Digital Responsibility Principles to Guide Progress, (2018); Corporate Digital Responsibility, (2021); Process Management A Multi Disciplinary Guide to Theory Modeling and Methodology, (2014); Five Elements of the Future of Trust, (2020); Praxisleitfaden Corporate Digital Responsibility Unternehmerische Verantwortung Und Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement Im Digitalzeitalter, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","23985046; 23985038","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108156064"

With the use of descriptive analysis and normative argument, it provides examples of unfair commercial practices by large enterprises within the travel sector and explains how they breach the EU legal regulation. The article concludes that the concept of CSR covers actions which go above the basic legal regulation and since the practices performed by the enterprises within the travel sector discussed in the article breach several legal regulations, they may not be presented as CSR activities.","Consumer Protection; Csr; Unfair Commercial Practices","","","Alvarado-Herrera, Alejandro, A Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility Following the Sustainable Development Paradigm, Journal of Business Ethics, 140, 2, pp. 243-262, (2017); Airbnb Cooperates with European Commission and Eu Consumer Authorities Improving the Way It Presents Offers; EE Working Papers; Bello, K.

Defined as actions to promote financial inclusion through digital financial services, digital financial inclusion brings new opportunities for the implementation of corporate innovation projects and the improvement of corporation value. Based on the annual reports (2012–2020) released by 1604 listed SMEs in China and the index of digital financial inclusion from Peking University, this paper explores the way that digital financial inclusion affects the corporation value of SMEs, with some moderating factors such as the financial flexibility, corporate social responsibility and product market competition in ambidextrous innovation. The study shows, in SMEs: (1) digital financial inclusion has a significant positive impact on exploitative innovation, but has less effect on exploratory innovation with a time lag; (2) ambidextrous innovation plays a partial intermediary role in the effect of digital financial inclusion on corporation value; (3) financial flexibility of the enterprise positively moderates the relationship between digital financial inclusion and corporate value. In the short term, corporate social responsibility negatively moderates the relationship between digital financial inclusion and corporate value; however, in the long term, it does contribute to the growth of corporate value. (4) Product market competition positively moderates the relationship between digital financial inclusion and exploitative innovation, but does not positively moderate the relationship between digital financial inclusion and exploratory innovation.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporation Value; Digital Financial Inclusion; Financial Flexibility; Product Market Competition; Competition (economics); Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Financial System; Innovation; Market System; China","competition (economics); corporate social responsibility; digitization; financial system; innovation; market system; China","This research was funded by [National Natural Science Foundation of China “A study of the willingness to identify, identification techniques and economic consequences of the quality of accounting information in credit resource allocation”] grant number [71462004]; [Key Research Base Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of Guangxi Universities].","Gabor, Daniela Veronica, The digital revolution in financial inclusion: international development in the fintech era, New Political Economy, 22, 4, pp. 423-436, (2017); Yang, Liu, Digital financial inclusion and sustainable growth of small and micro enterprises-evidence based on China's new third board market listed companies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Ji, Xuanming, Has digital financial inclusion narrowed the urban-rural income gap: The role of entrepreneurship in China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 15, (2021); Wang, Xue, Digital financial inclusion and farmers' vulnerability to poverty: Evidence from rural China, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 4, (2020); Chen, Boou, Poverty reduction in rural China: Does the digital finance matter?, PLOS ONE, 16, 12 December 2021, (2021); Pana, Elisabeta, The impact of internet-based services on credit unions: a propensity score matching approach, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 44, 2, pp. 329-352, (2015); Ozili, Peterson K., Impact of digital finance on financial inclusion and stability, Borsa Istanbul Review, 18, 4, pp. 329-340, (2018); Jagtiani, Julapa A., Do fintech lenders penetrate areas that are underserved by traditional banks?, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 43-54, (2018); Hsu, Po Hsuan, Financial development and innovation: Cross-country evidence, Journal of Financial Economics, 112, 1, pp. 116-135, (2014); Pradhan, Rudra Prakash, Innovation, financial development and economic growth in Eurozone countries, Applied Economics Letters, 23, 16, pp. 1141-1144, (2016)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144910605"

Technology, mainly digital technology, has altered global business practices. To stay ahead of their competitors, marketers need to develop new strategies that make use of digital technology. Using more conventional forms of competition will not result in spectacular outcomes. In this respect, the rise of social media is a game-changer in marketing since it provides marketers with a strategic touchpoint to engage customers with a brand. Still, it is also important to note the customer’s attitude towards social media. Previous studies have, for the most part, ignored the connection between programs involving corporate social responsibility (CSR) and positive experiences for customers. As a result, the current study intends to evaluate the relationship between customer-related CSR activities on social media, customer attitude towards social media, and consumer behavioral outcomes, such as purchase intentions (PI) and electronic word of mouth (E-WOM). Information was collected from banking customers in a developing economy and evaluated with Smart PLS 4.0. According to the findings, customer-related corporate social responsibility activities carried out on social media have an effect on attitudes toward social media, customer behavioral outcomes, such as electronic word of mouth (E-WOM), and buying intentions. The findings also show that a consumer’s feelings toward a brand can bridge the gap between customer-related CSR, E-WOM, and purchase intentions. The current study’s outcomes can help policymakers comprehend the value of CSR practices from the standpoint of marketing, which is something that most CSR researchers overlook.","Attitude Towards Social Media; Corporate Social Responsibility; Electronic Word Of Mouth; Purchase Intentions","","This research no received external funding.","Wang, Ruoxu, Communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) on social media: How do message source and types of CSR messages influence stakeholders’ perceptions?, Corporate Communications, 23, 3, pp. 326-341, (2018); van Doorn, Jenny, The impact of corporate social responsibility on customer attitudes and retention—the moderating role of brand success indicators, Marketing Letters, 28, 4, pp. 607-619, (2017); García-De-Los-Salmones-Sánchez, María Del Mar, Determinants of Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Social Networking Sites About Negative News on CSR, Journal of Business Ethics, 171, 3, pp. 583-597, (2021); Zhang, Qingyu, Linking Corporate Social Responsibility, Consumer Identification and Purchasing Intention, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 19, (2022); Fatma, Mobin, CSR and consumer behavioral responses: the role of customer-company identification, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 30, 2, pp. 460-477, (2018); Fatma, Mobin, An investigation of consumer evaluation of authenticity of their company's CSR engagement, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, pp. 1-18, (2020); Latif, Khawaja Fawad, Revisiting the relationship between corporate social responsibility and organizational performance: The mediating role of team outcomes, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 4, pp. 1630-1641, (2020); van Doorn, Jenny, Sustainability claims and perceived product quality: The moderating role of brand CSR, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Siyal, Saeed, The Impact of Corporate Culture on Corporate Social Responsibility: Role of Reputation and Corporate Sustainability, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 16, (2022); Badawi, Badawi, The Linkage of Perceived CSR, Corporate Reputation, Organizational Commitment, and Purchase Intention, Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, 11, 2, pp. 71-82, (2022)","","MDPI","2076328X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144708225"

This study aimed to describe: 1) how the tobacco industry has undermined tobacco control efforts and adapted its tactics in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors, 2) the political factors that hinder progress, and 3) the expert recommendations to overcome challenges of tobacco control in the ASEAN region. METHODS During the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative interviews were conducted with tobacco control experts to explore their perspectives and recommendations to address the barriers and challenges of tobacco control in ASEAN LMICs. RESULTS Eleven tobacco control experts participated in interviews. Five themes emerged from the data: 1) a shift to below-the-line marketing and digital technologies to target youth; 2) industry develops new tactics to undermine tobacco control; 3) cigarette packet branding – the last remaining marketing channel; 4) political factors hindering tobacco control; and 5) broader involvement and collaboration in tobacco control. CONCLUSIONS The tobacco industry continues to undermine tobacco control in ASEAN LMICs, shifting its marketing, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and lobbying tactics in response to changing regulations, digital technologies, and the COVID-19 pandemic. While lack of government leadership also hinders progress, full adoption of the FCTC and increased collaboration in tobacco control are recommended to overcome these issues.","Covid-19; Fctc; Lmics; Tobacco Industry; Youth; Advertising; Article; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Digital Technology; Government; Human; Human Experiment; Interview; Low Income Country; Marketing; Middle Income Country; Open Ended Questionnaire; Pandemic; Politics; Social Media; Tobacco Control; Tobacco Industry","advertising; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; digital technology; government; human; human experiment; interview; low income country; marketing; middle income country; open ended questionnaire; pandemic; politics; social media; tobacco control; tobacco industry","Another key finding was that cigarette packet branding has become an increasingly critical part of the tobacco industry’s marketing strategy in ASEAN LMICs, particularly as greater restrictions are imposed in countries that have adopted the FCTC and policies on mass-media marketing. This finding aligns with to prevent industry interference. These findings align previous work demonstrating the industry’s increased with a previous study, showing that efforts to stop reliance on cigarette packet branding in high-income tobacco industry interference have declined in some countries with comprehensive TAPS bans6,10. With ASEAN LMICs21. The current study also revealed only three countries in the ASEAN region having that the tobacco industry had a favorable relationship introduced or planning to introduce plain packaging with some governments, particularly because they (Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar), cigarette packet provided tax revenue and employment. This situation branding remains an effective marketing tool used is particularly challenging in ASEAN LMICs where freely by the industry in most of the region16,17. governments’ agendas on economic development Our study highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 and poverty reduction are used by the industry to pandemic on tobacco control efforts, including gain influence20,22. These transitional economies shifting government priorities from tobacco control may face increased challenges to decouple their to pandemic responses. This situation was seen economic development interests from the industry’s as contributing to the delay of tobacco control interference. The findings also showed that lack of policymaking and implementation, highlighting the government commitment and leadership in tobacco importance of government and institutional policies control in many countries hinders progress in the and funding to support continuity of tobacco control region. To address these challenges, the experts called efforts during future pandemics or crises. The for increase collaboration in tobacco control between findings also revealed how political factors hinder governments, the public, and civil society; as well tobacco control in LMICs in the region, including as a national framework and whole-of-government lack of enforcement of TAPS restrictions, insufficient approach towards a unified and congruent response. fines to deter violations, and lack of government leadership to institutionalize tobacco control. While Limitations these results align with what has been revealed in This study had several limitations. First, the study did Indonesia22,23, the current study suggests that these not recruit experts from all eight LMICs in the ASEAN challenges occur more broadly throughout LMICs in region, with in-country experts from Myanmar, Laos the ASEAN region. and Vietnam not involved. These experts may have While the aim of tobacco industry’s CSR in high-provided additional insights into tobacco control income countries is reputation repair, in LMICs, CSR challenges faced and successes attained in these seems to be used to enhance or maintain its largely countries. Moreover, the study did not focus on positive image37. Previous work involving interviews the region’s high-income countries (Singapore and with tobacco control experts from LMICs found that Brunei). Second, six of the eleven participants were much of the tobacco industry’s CSR targeted the from Cambodia and Indonesia, which may have health sector, suggesting its use to reduce the focus on emphasized issues in these countries over others in the harms of tobacco products37. Similarly, the current the region. Third, interviews were only conducted in study identified that the tobacco industry used the English, which may have limited the recruitment of COVID-19 pandemic to increase its health-related CSR non-English-speaking tobacco control experts. Fourth, efforts, including donating medical supplies and funds the interviews were conducted by an Australian, to assist governments and civil society organizations which may have created a cross-cultural barrier with with their response to the crisis. While these findings some participants from ASEAN countries. Fifth, this highlight the industry’s ability to rapidly adapt its CSR analysis was narrowly based on expert views and does efforts to exploit health emergencies and changing not include broader data related to behaviors, sales, situations, they also demonstrate governments’ and regulations of tobacco brands. willingness to accept financial and in-kind support from the tobacco industry. CONCLUSIONS Our study identified examples of tobacco industry While most ASEAN LMICs have adopted the FCTC, CSR and lobbying in most ASEAN LMICs, including bans on mass media marketing, and measures to prevent interference in public policies, the tobacco industry continues to undermine these efforts by shifting to below-the-line marketing and digital technologies, exploiting loopholes in or violating regulations, and leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic for their marketing, CSR, and lobbying tactics. With LMICs having salient concerns around economic development and poverty reduction, governments may find it challenging to decouple their tobacco control efforts from the industry’s promise of employment and tax revenues. Tobacco control in the region has been hindered by lack of government leadership, effective implementation of regulations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, with governments’ pivoting to address this health crisis. Full adoption of the FCTC and increased collaboration in the implementation and monitoring of tobacco control are recommended to overcome these issues.","Tobacco Control Atlas Asean Region, (2016); Goodchild, Mark, Global economic cost of smoking-attributable diseases, Tobacco Control, 27, 1, pp. 58-64, (2018); Barrington-Trimis, Jessica L., Trends in the Age of Cigarette Smoking Initiation Among Young Adults in the US From 2002 to 2018, JAMA Network Open, 3, 10, (2020); Reitsma, Marissa Bettay, Spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in prevalence of smoking tobacco use and initiation among young people in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019, The Lancet Public Health, 6, 7, pp. e472-e481, (2021); Amul, Gianna Gayle Herrera, The State of Tobacco Control in ASEAN: Framing the Implementation of the FCTC from a Health Systems Perspective, Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies, 5, 1, pp. 47-64, (2018); Wakefield, Melanie A., The cigarette pack as image: New evidence from tobacco industry documents, Tobacco Control, 11, SUPPL.1, pp. i73-i80, (2002); Carter, S.

In this paper, we study the impact of digital finance on corporate social responsibility performance of pollution-intensive industry. From the perspective of theoretical mechanism, digital finance could influence corporate social responsibility performance through financing effect. Then, we use the data of Chinese listed companies and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU_DFIIC) to empirically test the influence of digital finance on corporate social responsibility of pollution-intensive industry. The results show that digital finance is positively related to the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility of pollution-intensive industry. The mechanism test shows that by reducing the information asymmetry in the financial market and making them easier for enterprises to access the financial market, digital finance effectively alleviates the financing constraints of enterprises and then enables enterprises to invest more capital in corporate social responsibility. Furthermore, we find that there are heterogeneous influences of digital finance on the corporate social responsibility performance of different types of enterprises. Specially, enterprises with small scale, located in high informatization and marketization areas and eastern regions of China, and enterprises with high ownership concentration will enjoy more positive impact. By using different indicators to measure digital finance and changing samples for robustness checks, the research conclusions of the paper are still valid. Therefore, government should make more effort to support the development of digital finance, so as to promote corporate social responsibility of pollution-intensive industry and the green and sustainable development of the economy.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Finance; Financing Mechanism; Heterogeneous Influence; Asymmetry; Corporate Social Responsibility; Financial Market; Information; Sustainable Development; China; Human; Industry; Pollution; Social Responsibility; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Social Responsibility; Sustainable Development","asymmetry; corporate social responsibility; financial market; information; sustainable development; China; human; industry; pollution; social responsibility; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Social Responsibility; Sustainable Development","The authors would like to appreciate the financial support from the China Shandong Province Natural Science Foundation (grant number: ZR2020QG027) and Youth Innovation Science and Technology Program of Shandong Province (grant number: 2019RWE015).","Ang, Rui, The relationship between CSR and financial performance and the moderating effect of ownership structure: Evidence from Chinese heavily polluting listed enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 30, pp. 117-129, (2022); Arrigo, Elisa, Followership behavior and corporate social responsibility disclosure: Analysis and implications for sustainability research, Journal of Cleaner Production, 360, (2022); Bárcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos, International trade and environmental corporate social responsibility, Energy Economics, 115, (2022); Borghesi, Richard A., Corporate socially responsible investments: CEO altruism, reputation, and shareholder interests, Journal of Corporate Finance, 26, pp. 164-181, (2014); Cao, Shutao, Credit constraints and productivity of SMEs: Evidence from Canada, Economic Modelling, 88, pp. 163-180, (2020); Chan, Chiaying, Do financial constraints matter when firms engage in CSR?, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 39, pp. 241-259, (2017); Chen, Yongmin, Improving market performance in the digital economy, China Economic Review, 62, (2020); Chen, Shengqi, Does digital finance promote manufacturing servitization: Micro evidence from China, International Review of Economics and Finance, 76, pp. 856-869, (2021); Cheng, Cheng, Venture capital and corporate social responsibility, Journal of Corporate Finance, 75, (2022); Dang, Vinh Q.T., Does the nature of political connection matter for corporate social responsibility engagement?

The pandemic restrictions deepened the era of social distancing between young consumers and drew them further into the online environment, which allowed e-merchants to impress them even more, and with more ease, with the use of suitable online marketing communication. The overabundance of e-shops on the market may be very confusing for the consumer at this time, meaning that the corporate online reputation and its sustainability has never been as important as it is now. The investigation of online shopping consumer behavior and the factors that determine it is at the center of interest in both academic and practical spheres. In our study, we focused in more detail on investigating the relationship between the online shopping consumer behavior of young consumers and the perceived reputation of an e-shop in the era of digitization. The research sample consisted of 633 young consumer respondents. The method of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used in order to investigate the factors of online shopping consumer behavior, and the method of Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) model regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between individual factors and the perceived reputation of an e-shop. According to the results of EFA, four factors were identified: digital security, e-shop services, e-trust, and social responsibility and promotion. Subsequent testing confirmed the significant relationship between factors of online shopping consumer behavior and the perceived reputation of an e-shop in five cases.","Online Shopping Behavior; Reputation; Young Consumers; Covid-19; Perception; Questionnaire Survey; Shopping Activity; Sustainability; World Wide Web; Young Population","COVID-19; perception; questionnaire survey; shopping activity; sustainability; World Wide Web; young population","Funding text 1: This research is one of the partial outputs under the scientific research grant GaPU 15/2021; VEGA 1/0488/22; VEGA 1/0694/20.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the Grant agency of the University of Prešov, project no.

In this study, we analyzed the effective practices for online learning comparing schools and private supplementary tutoring. South Korea is an appropriate country for this investigation, as public and private education sectors have attempted to advance online teaching and learning and approximately 80% of Korean elementary and secondary school students take online courses provided by private tutoring institutes. This qualitative study reveals that online learning in private supplementary tutoring, commonly known as shadow education, is highly advanced and favored by students and parents compared to that of schools. The features of online learning in shadow education include individualized learning, effective communication skills under post-human space, attention skills for cyber learning, and advanced Internet technologies and tools. The study results have practical implications for educational administrators and schoolteachers concerning effective online teaching and learning. In addition, we suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of online learning is needed to guide schoolteachers and policymakers.","Education For Social Responsibility; Educational Technologies; Internet-based Private Tutoring; Korean Education; Online Learning; Shadow Education; Communication; Corporate Social Responsibility; Education; Learning; Schooling Behavior; Teaching; South Korea","communication; corporate social responsibility; education; learning; schooling behavior; teaching; South Korea","","Bennett, Sue J., Becoming an online teacher: Adapting to a changed environment for teaching and learning in higher education, Educational Media International, 41, 3, pp. 231-248, (2004); Vlachopoulos, Dimitrios, Online communication and interaction in distance higher education: A framework study of good practice, International Review of Education, 65, 4, pp. 605-632, (2019); Educational Technology Research, (2004); J Korea Acad Ind Coop Soc, (2020); Multimedia Assisted Language Learning, (2021); J Korea Soc Comput Inf, (2000); Kim, Young-chun, Shadow Education and the Curriculum and Culture of Schooling in South Korea, Curriculum Studies Worldwide, Part F2415, pp. 1-206, (2016); Kim, Young-chun, Conceptualizing shadow curriculum: definition, features and the changing landscapes of learning cultures, Journal of Curriculum Studies, 51, 2, pp. 141-161, (2019); Shadow Education as Worldwide Curriculum Studies, (2019); Weller, Toni, History in the digital age, pp. 1-211, (2012)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148086368"

They are aimed at all members of society, including businesses, which could integrate SDGs within their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies. As family firms constitute the most widespread form of business, understanding the factors that drive the decisions to pursue SDGs is essential. Thus, this research aims to understand why a family firm complies with SDGs. Additionally, it examines how SDGs enter, at the strategic level, activities and management practices. Following the case study method, the paper focuses on a family firm based in Italy, by means of documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews, and online data. In line with the Socioemotional Wealth (SEW) theory, family and personal values are crucial. While SDGs are only now entering the strategic level, their rationale has always been part of the family values, and the firm's culture. The selected firm is pursuing ten Goals. SDGs serve as a further motivator for family firms to behave more responsibly, meaning that they help to align the firm's strategy with the global challenges, building on existing family and firm's values. Our paper brings several contributions to the family business, CSR and SDGs literature, providing a representation of the reasons why a family firm pursues SDGs and the first reaction phases to SDGs. It brings practical implications for policymakers, highlighting the role of family values as the main drivers of the choice to invest in SDGs. By providing unique evidence, it is the first to connect the family business literature, CSR and SDGs.","Case Study; Csr; Family Firms; Sdgs; Socioemotional Wealth Theory; Digital Storage; Planning; Business Understanding; Case-studies; Corporate Social Responsibility; Family Business; Family Firms; Socioemotional Wealth Theory; Strategic Activities; Strategic Level; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; Sustainable Development","Digital storage; Planning; Business understanding; Case-studies; Corporate social responsibility; Family business; Family firms; Socioemotional wealth theory; Strategic activities; Strategic level; Sustainable development goal; United Nations; Sustainable development","The interests and activities towards CSR and sustainability materialized in a series of activities, news items, documents, reports and awards, which include CSR reporting (which started in 2012), the title of “Best Managed Company” from Deloitte for three years in a row, a concrete investment in the local environment and cultural heritage (the firm is a Corporate Golden Donor of the Fondo Ambiente Italiano - the National Trust of Italy - from 2015), and corporate communications which from 2011 have promoted sustainable growth and development. CSR and sustainability also appear central in the firm's communications on online social networks, as witnessed by the firm's tweets.Third, this research is the first one bridging the gap between family firms, CSR and SDGs, bringing new data and insights on a globally important, albeit under-investigated phenomenon. Last, from a methodological perspective, one of the novelties of our research is complementing the traditional secondary data sources with data from online social networks (namely, Twitter posts). To the best of our knowledge, case studies do not usually include secondary data from online social networks, though some papers have argued that online social networks could support research into firms’ CSR engagement (Patuelli et al., 2021).","J Bus Ethics, (2021); Basco, Rodrigo, Family business and regional development-A theoretical model of regional familiness, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 6, 4, pp. 259-271, (2015); Bebbington, Jan, Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: An enabling role for accounting research, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 31, 1, pp. 2-24, (2018); Bergamaschi, Mara, The futures of family businesses and the development of corporate social responsibility, Futures, 75, pp. 54-65, (2016); Berrone, Pascual, Socioemotional Wealth in Family Firms: Theoretical Dimensions, Assessment Approaches, and Agenda for Future Research, Family Business Review, 25, 3, pp. 258-279, (2012); Bose, Sudipta, Sustainable development goals (SDGs) reporting and the role of country-level institutional factors: An international evidence, Journal of Cleaner Production, 335, (2022); Bowen, Howard R., Social responsibilities of the businessman, pp. 1-248, (2013); Breton-Miller, Isabelle Le, Family firms and practices of sustainability: A contingency view, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 7, 1, pp. 26-33, (2016); Calvo, Nuria, Analysis of the growth of the e-learning industry through sustainable business model archetypes: A case study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 191, pp. 26-39, (2018); Campopiano, Giovanna, Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting: A Content Analysis in Family and Non-family Firms, Journal of Business Ethics, 129, 3, pp. 511-534, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137172181"

However, the impact of ECSR on actual pro-environmental behavior remains unclear in the literature, particularly in the context of developing countries. Grounded in the social exchange and social network theories, this study examines the effect of ECSR on pro-environmental behavior via the mediation of a green shared vision and the moderation of two types of personal ties (business ties and political ties). Data was collected and analyzed from 375 manufacturing sector employees in Pakistan at two time periods. The results show that ECSR (at time 1) drives actual pro-environmental behavior (at time 2). Specifically, implementing ECSR can significantly enhance an employee's pro-environmental behavior via its green shared vision. In addition, business ties were found to strengthen the relationship between ECSR and green shared vision. In contrast, political ties were revealed to weaken the connection between ECSR and green shared vision, thus affecting sustainable development objectives. Our findings provide implications for policymakers and practitioners to promote ECSR in developing countries.","Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Green Shared Vision; Pakistan; Personal Ties; Pro-environmental Behavior; Sustainable Development; Developing Countries; Digital Storage; Personnel; Planning; Social Aspects; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility; Green Shared Vision; Pakistan; Personal Tie; Policy Makers; Pro-environmental Behaviors; Shared Vision; Social Exchange; Social Network Theory; Sustainable Development; Article; Developing Country; Employee; Human; Physician; Pro-environmental Behavior; Social Network; Social Responsibility; Sustainable Development; Vision","Developing countries; Digital storage; Personnel; Planning; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental corporate social responsibility; Green shared vision; Pakistan; Personal tie; Policy makers; Pro-environmental behaviors; Shared vision; Social exchange; Social network theory; Sustainable development; article; developing country; employee; human; physician; pro-environmental behavior; social network; social responsibility; sustainable development; vision","","Adomako, Samuel, Regulatory environment, environmental dynamism, political ties, and performance: Study of entrepreneurial firms in a developing economy, Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 21, 2, pp. 212-230, (2014); Afsar, Bilal, Responsible leadership and employee's proenvironmental behavior: The role of organizational commitment, green shared vision, and internal environmental locus of control, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 1, pp. 297-312, (2020); Afsar, Bilal, Frontline employees’ high-performance work practices, trust in supervisor, job-embeddedness and turnover intentions in hospitality industry, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 3, pp. 1436-1452, (2018); Afsar, Bilal, Corporate social responsibility and pro-environmental behavior at workplace: The role of moral reflectiveness, coworker advocacy, and environmental commitment, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 1, pp. 109-125, (2020); Ahmad, Naveed, Relationship between corporate social responsibility at the micro-level and environmental performance: The mediating role of employee pro-environmental behavior and the moderating role of gender, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1138-1148, (2021); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); International Journal of Business Economics and Management, (2017); Alt, Elisa, Linking Employee Stakeholders to Environmental Performance: The Role of Proactive Environmental Strategies and Shared Vision, Journal of Business Ethics, 128, 1, pp. 167-181, (2015); Alvarado-Herrera, Alejandro, A Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility Following the Sustainable Development Paradigm, Journal of Business Ethics, 140, 2, pp. 243-262, (2017); Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike, (1987)","","Elsevier B.V.","09213449; 18790658","","RCREE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135005697"

Previous studies have mainly focused on the economic consequences of digital transformation. However, research on the effect of digital transformation on reducing firms’ emissions is relatively rare. This study focused on two kinds of typical environmental pollutants: waste gas emissions and wastewater emissions. Using data on Chinese listed firms from 2010 to 2018 and adopting the fixed effect model to investigate the emission reduction effect and mechanism of digital transformation on waste gas emissions and wastewater emissions of firms, we found the following: (1) digital transformation significantly reduces pollution emissions; (2) the relationship is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), high-polluting enterprises, and economically developed regions; (3) to gain a more in-depth understanding of how digital transformation affects the pollution emission behavior of firms, we further conducted mechanism tests and found that digital transformation reduces pollution by increasing total factor productivity and green innovation and improving firms’ internal controls. The above conclusions still hold after a series of robustness tests, including alternative econometric specifications and overcoming potential endogeneity with an instrumental variable. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the effect of digital transformation on environmental pollution emissions. Hence, all governments should pay more attention to digital transformation for sustainable development and improved environmental quality.","Digital Transformation; Environmental Pollution; Green Innovation; Internal Corporate Governance; Total Factor Productivity; Environmental Pollutants; Waste Water; Climate Change; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Impact; Innovation; Total Factor Productivity; Wastewater Treatment; Article; Attention; China; Gas Waste; Government; Human; Instrumental Variable Analysis; Productivity; Sustainable Development; Wastewater; Organization; Pollutant; Social Responsibility; Environmental Pollutants; Organizations; Social Responsibility; Waste Water","climate change; corporate social responsibility; environmental impact; innovation; total factor productivity; wastewater treatment; article; attention; China; gas waste; government; human; instrumental variable analysis; productivity; sustainable development; wastewater; organization; pollutant; social responsibility; Environmental Pollutants; Organizations; Social Responsibility; Waste Water","","Ebenstein, Avraham Y., Growth, pollution, and life expectancy: China from 1991-2012, American Economic Review, 105, 5, pp. 226-231, (2015); Graff Zivin, Joshua S., The impact of pollution on worker productivity, American Economic Review, 102, 7, pp. 3652-3673, (2012); OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050, (2012); Lee, Su-yol, Corporate carbon strategies in responding to climate change, Business Strategy and the Environment, 21, 1, pp. 33-48, (2012); Vial, Gregory, Understanding digital transformation: A review and a research agenda, pp. 13-66, (2021); MIT Sloan Management Review, (2015); What is Industry 4 0 Everything You Need to Know, (2019); Awan, Usama, Industry 4.0 and the circular economy: A literature review and recommendations for future research, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 4, pp. 2038-2060, (2021); Rosa, Paolo, Assessing relations between Circular Economy and Industry 4.0: a systematic literature review, International Journal of Production Research, 58, 6, pp. 1662-1687, (2020); Wu, Keping, Does the digital transformation of enterprises affect stock price crash risk?, Finance Research Letters, 48, (2022)","","MDPI","16604601; 16617827","","","36232146","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139940164"

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Technology, Megatrends and Work. Of all the profound changes in business, technology is perhaps the most ubiquitous. There is not a facet of our lives unaffected by internet technologies and artificial intelligence. The Journal of Business Ethics established a dedicated section that focuses on Technology and Business Ethics, yet issues related to this phenomenon run right through all the sections. Kirsten Martin, editor of the Technology and Business Ethics section, joins our interim social media editor, Hannah Trittin-UIbrich, to advance a human-centric approach to the development and application of digital technologies that places Business Ethics at centre of the analysis. For Shuili Du, technology is the defining condition for a new era of Corporate Social Responsibility—CSR 3.0—which she defines as “a company’s socially responsible strategies and practices that deal with key ethical and socio-technical issues associated with AI and related technologies on the one hand and leverage the power of AI and related technologies to tackle social and environmental problems on the other hand.” It is not just technologies that are a determining feature of our lives but technology companies, an argument made by Glen Whelan as he examines Big Business and the need for a Big Business Ethics as we try to understand the impact of Big Tech on our post-work world. Indeed, as noted by Ernesto Noronha and Premilla D’Cruz, megatrends in addition to advancement in technologies, namely globalization, the greening of economies, and changes in demographics and migration, are shaping the future for workers in ways previously unimaginable. Contributing to this important debate, Praveen Parboteeah considers the influence of another longstanding but oft overlooked megatrend, the role of religion in the workplace. Given the enormity of the influence of technology and other megatrends in our world, it is not surprising that this essay introduces ground-breaking ideas that speak to the future of business ethics research.","Accountability; Artificial Intelligence; Big Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Demographic Challenge; Digital Technology; Ecosystem; Global Production Networks; Just Transition; Platforms; Post-work; Religion; Robots","","","Abeliansky, Ana Lucia, The future of work: Meeting the global challenges of demographic change and automation, International Labour Review, 159, 3, pp. 285-306, (2020); Best Versus the Rest the Global Productivity Slowdown Divergence Across Firms and the Role of Public Policy, (2016); Autor, David H., Why are there still so many jobs? the history and future of workplace automation, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 3, pp. 3-30, (2015); Big Tech Companies are at War with Employees Over Remote Work, (2021); undefined, (2021); Barrientos, Stephanie Ware, Decent work in global production networks: Framing the policy debate, International Labour Review, 150, 3-4, pp. 297-317, (2011); Berger, Ellie D., Ageism at Work: Deconstructing Age and Gender in the Discriminating Labour Market, pp. 1-206, (2021); Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies, (2014); Braunstein, Ruth, The role of bridging cultural practices in racially and socioeconomically diverse civic organizations, American Sociological Review, 79, 4, pp. 705-725, (2014); Castellini, Valentina, Environmentalism put to work: Ideologies of green recruitment in Toronto, Geoforum, 104, pp. 63-70, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","01674544; 15730697","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139201492"

This study mainly discusses the evolution of corporate governance structure based on the complex adaptive system of blockchain network security. The blockchain is actually very similar to the accounting book. The account book formed by the summary of the accounting vouchers in each month of the enterprise is equivalent to each block, and the account book formed by the sequential connection is equivalent to the block chain formed by concatenating the blocks. This article believes that in the corporate governance system, the maximum fairness and the highest efficiency are always the basic goals pursued by the system, and the balance between fairness and efficiency is the basic principle. The research content of the corporate governance system mainly involves a series of issues such as the allocation of rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders, the arrangement of residual distribution rights, and the way of participating in governance with the principal-agent relationship between the internal owners and managers of the enterprise as the core. In the company's network communication structure, the first layer is the stakeholder level, that is, the interactive protocol layer (knowledge layer) between multiple agents. The specific technology is realized through networked audio and video. The second layer is the communication language layer between Agents. Define the grammar and semantics of the Agent communication language, and realize the message transfer between Agents. The third layer is the data transmission mechanism (communication layer) between Agents. The Internet (CORBA/Java) is used to realize the establishment of agent object communication between the server and the client, and the data transmission between Agents is realized through the TCP/IP protocol. The fourth layer is the data layer. The database structure is used to realize data storage, and the data storage, query and other functions are realized through database access. The fifth layer is the support layer. Provide physical connection and specific operation platform for company governance system data transmission and exchange, and other management software and application programs.

The pandemic scenario, its impact on the mentor university's social responsibility and the way DT&Ts can assist are investigated in this article. Design/methodology/approach: The interactions with experts and students were conducted to explore the DT&Ts for learning exchanges. Next, structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to validate the model and perform regression analysis. The quantitative data collection was made through questionnaires during the second deadly wave of COVID-19 that hit India. Findings: The independent variables (IVs) such as the IT infrastructure support (IT_IS), virtual collaborative tools (VCTs) and future-oriented technologies (FOTs) have a significant impact on the CSR learning outcomes (CSR_LOs) of undergraduate students under the mentorship program. However, IV research instruments for innovation could not make a significant effect. Research limitations/implications: The IVs IT_IS, VCTs and FOTs influence the CSR_LOs, while RII does not have an influential impact. Practical implications: As the online learning environment is expected to stay at least in a blended form, adequate CSR funding in infrastructure is necessitated to harness the full potential of this important resource, technology. The results of this empirical investigation affirm that IT_IS, VOTs and FOTs significantly impact CSR_LOs during the crisis. The study findings would encourage the mendtor universities and their stakeholders, including the mentee universities, to evolve and create an ecosystem for effective management of these resources to attain positive outcomes. The study findings can guide the mentor universities in managing uncertainties like pandemics and effectively using the earlier-mentioned critical resources for social responsibility. This research also allows the development of future applications adnd models in mentor-mentee universities for social responsibility, post-pandemic transformation and resilience. Social implications: The DT&Ts came to the immediate rescue during the pandemic and positively affected collaborative CSR_LOs by the mentor universities, but they have not evolved to a level where offline learning can be replaced entirely. Hence, it can be inferred that a hybrid model is preferable. The study also improves the understanding of how DT&Ts are being harnessed to aid collaborative learning in fulfilling the mentors' CSR in fatal emergencies. The purpose is to equip the education system through mentorship so that universities can sustain, innovate and grow even in trying times. Also, it discusses the dynamics of various DT&Ts for creating a sustainable learning environment and utilizing them to make the teaching prolific and influential. Originality/value: There is a scarcity of literature regarding the learning outcomes realized through CSR initiatives and collaboration between mentor-mentee institutions. There is a need to understand how these knowledge exchanges continued despite the physical restrictions during the pandemic. In this direction, this study helps to understand how the DT&Ts played a critical role in continuing learning and keeping abreast in a knowledge society from the perspective of resource-based view (RBV) in these precarious situations.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Covid-19; Digital Tools; Education; Knowledge Exchange; Resource-based View; Student Learning","","","Ahmad, Tashfeen, Preparing for the future of higher education, On the Horizon, 23, 4, pp. 323-330, (2015); Al-Samarraie, Hosam, A systematic review of cloud computing tools for collaborative learning: Opportunities and challenges to the blended-learning environment, Computers and Education, 124, pp. 77-91, (2018); Alanis-Funes, Gerardo J., Virtual collaborative space to support active learning, Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE, (2011); Alsabawy, Ahmed Younis, IT infrastructure services as a requirement for e-learning system success, Computers and Education, 69, pp. 431-451, (2013); Education Management Strategies and Technology Fluidity in the Asian Business Sector, (2018); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Technium Social Sciences Journal, (2020); International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, (2017); Bagozzi, Richard P., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Abu Bakar, Lily Julienti, Assessing the relationship between firm resources and product innovation performance: A resource-based view, Business Process Management Journal, 16, 3, pp. 420-435, (2010)","","Emerald Publishing","00251747","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134566013"

Design/methodology/approach: The article builds on the literature related to framing, issue arenas and moral evaluations to unravel how evaluative framing and counterframing are implemented in multimodal digital spaces and how social practices get legitimized or delegitimized according to different communicative purposes. It presents a longitudinal critical discourse analysis of the issue-related webpages and press releases of PepsiCo, one of the worst global plastic polluters, and of the global environmental movement #breakfreefromplastic. Findings: Findings suggest that the systematic recurrence of specific evaluative strategies has a double macro-function: (a) organizing discourses strategically through its presence or absence; (b) signalling the moral significance of recontextualized social practices by conferring legitimacy to remedial actions and/or illegitimacy to deviant actions.

Based on the results obtained, the paper proposes a conceptual model to address the following research questions. How does the ethical responsibility of a company impact the digital transformation of work? How does the digitalization of work relate to the ethical responsibility of a company? How does open innovation advance the ethical responsibility of a company? The research follows the logic of the elaboration of a conceptual model. The theoretical novelty of the article is expressed in the fact that 25 criteria, through which the relationships between the studied concepts are manifested, were identified and systematized. To assess the significance of the criteria, a survey of experts was developed and conducted to obtain a diverse opinion. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (W) and Pearson’s chi-squared were used to measure the level of agreement of the experts’ evaluation. A conceptual model established the relationship pathways as well as inbound and outbound flows, and highlighted the key findings of the research. Namely, the guiding role of open innovation as the external circumstances for corporate ethical responsibility, and the necessity to apply all elements of ethical responsibility to ensure the viable digital transformation of work.","Conceptual Model; Digital Transformation; Digital Transformation Of Work; Ethical Responsibility; Open Innovation; Conceptual Framework; Ethics; Innovation; Research Method; Survey Method; Transformation","conceptual framework; ethics; innovation; research method; survey method; transformation","This research was funded by the Department of Corporate Finance and Economics, Riga Technical University, Latvia.

CMO communication on societal issues is understudied despite heightened global attention to brands’ social practices. This poses three research questions: (1) How central is corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sociopolitical activism in the communication of global brands’ CMOs?, (2) Does CMOs’ communication about CSR or sociopolitical activism have a digital impact?, and (3) How do brand origin (i.e., geographic location of headquarters) and CMO nationality (U.S. vs. non-U.S.) moderate the CSR/sociopolitical activism–digital communication impact? Drawing on expectancy violation theory, this research (N<inf>tweets</inf> = 17,468 over N<inf>CMOs</inf> = 81) finds that CMOs rarely publish CSR or sociopolitical activism communication on Twitter (5.3% and 3.2%) and demonstrates a higher digital impact of retweets for CSR and a lower impact for sociopolitical activism tweets than regular communication. Furthermore, non-U.S. headquarters and CMO nationality strengthen the positive effect of CSR communication and weaken the negative effect of sociopolitical activism communication.","Cmo; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Global Brands; Social Media; Sociopolitical Activism","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Marketing Science Institute, (grant number 4000057).","Afifi, Walid Adel, Characteristics and consequences of expectation violations in close relationships, Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 15, 3, pp. 365-392, (1998); Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility in the Digital Era, (2018); Balducci, Bitty, Unstructured data in marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 46, 4, pp. 557-590, (2018); Becker-Olsen, Karen L., A cross-cultural examination of corporate social responsibility marketing communications in Mexico and the United States: Strategies for global brands, Journal of International Marketing, 19, 2, pp. 30-44, (2011); Ad Age, (2009); Berger, Jonah A., Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight, Journal of Marketing, 84, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Bhagwat, Yashoda, Corporate Sociopolitical Activism and Firm Value, Journal of Marketing, 84, 5, pp. 1-21, (2020); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2016); Branicki, Layla J., The Morality of “new” CEO Activism, Journal of Business Ethics, 170, 2, pp. 269-285, (2021)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","1069031X; 15477215","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131300734"

In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on the relationship between digital transformation (DT) and CEM using a systematic review approach in the Antecedents, Decisions, and Outcomes (ADO) format. We review 181 papers published in almost 30 years from 1997 to 2022 and identify studies and areas where DT has impacted on CEM. We find that the literature examining the DT-CEM relationship has surged since 2019 and is concentrated in areas such as green sustainable science technology and environmental sciences. Further, we analyze the economic consequences of DT, the drivers of CEM, and the mechanisms of DT on CEM. Based on the literature analysis, we find that there is still a large gap in the literature studying the mediators and moderators of the DT-CEM relationship. Further, we find that firms with DT have better responsiveness and improved CEM by using digital resources to accurately capture the demands of different stakeholders on the environment. Finally, we provide a research framework and possible research directions, and propose corresponding management insights and policy recommendations.","Antecedents Decisions And Outcomes (ado); Corporate Environmental Management (cem); Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Technologies; Digital Transformation (dt); Resource-based View (rbv); Stakeholder Theory; Systematic Review","","This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers: 72173057, 7211101263 and 71672077), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (2021A1515011536), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (19JNKY08).","Acemoglu, Daron, Technology, information, and the decentralization of the firm, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122, 4, pp. 1759-1799, (2007); Aggarwal, Reena, Does governance travel around the world?

Therefore, in this study, we examined the relationship between the digital transformation of value chains and CSR performance and the moderating role of property ownership and market dependence. The results show that the digital transformation of value chains can improve CSR performance. When the three types of digital transformation are conducted at the same time, compared with digital manufacturing transformation and digital marketing transformation, digital management transformation has a greater impact on CSR performance. Non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises with higher market dependency show greater improvement in their CSR performance than state-owned enterprises and enterprises with lower market dependency as a result of the digital transformation of value chains. Furthermore, we found a certain degree of value mismatch between the digital transformation of the different value chain links of enterprises and the different dimensions of social responsibility. Specifically, the digital transformations of manufacturing, marketing, and management activities only exert a significant impact on shareholder responsibility, public responsibility, and shareholder and employee responsibility, respectively. This result indicates that the digital transformation of the entire value chain needs to be further optimized and integrated to achieve social responsibility values that match the value chain. This study not only helps enterprises identify the shortcomings in the digital transformation of the value chain but also provides development ideas for enterprises to realize the two-wheel drive of business value and social value through the digital transformation of the whole value chain.","Digital Transformation Of Value Chains; Market Dependence; Property Ownership; Social Responsibility Performance; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Activity; Industrial Performance; Manufacturing; Marketing; Ownership; Transformation","business; corporate social responsibility; economic activity; industrial performance; manufacturing; marketing; ownership; transformation","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 72062033, 71962035, 71762032).","Verhoef, Peter C., Digital transformation: A multidisciplinary reflection and research agenda, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 889-901, (2021); Bijmolt, Tammo H.A., Challenges at the marketing–operations interface in omni-channel retail environments, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 864-874, (2021); Toorajipour, Reza, Artificial intelligence in supply chain management: A systematic literature review, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 502-517, (2021); Nambisan, Satish, Digital innovation management: Reinventing innovation management research in a digital world, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 41, 1, pp. 223-238, (2017); Costa-Climent, Ricardo, Value creation through the evolution of business model themes, Journal of Business Research, 122, pp. 353-361, (2021); Fischer, Marcus, Strategy archetypes for digital transformation: Defining meta objectives using business process management, Information and Management, 57, 5, (2020); Mikalef, Patrick, Information technology-enabled dynamic capabilities and their indirect effect on competitive performance: Findings from PLS-SEM and fsQCA, Journal of Business Research, 70, pp. 1-16, (2017); Liu, Jiaojiao, Can Digital Transformation Promote the Rapid Recovery of Cities from the COVID-19 Epidemic?

On the other hand, energy is a critical pillar of the economic growth of the country. Meanwhile, global interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment is growing. The conventional investment paradigm is being phased out in favor of investments that prioritize environmental, social, and corporate responsibility. The energy sector is one of the most significantly affected. Presently, the field of digital transformation is limited in its analysis about the sustainability factors and is still controversial, especially in the energy business. This paper identifies an in-corporation factor in Industry 4.0, taking into account the effect on ESG. The research papers and the World Economic Forum reports were investigated and identified the correlation factor using machine learning to analyze their contents. We spotlighted the documents relevant to the energy industry and sustainable development. To quantify the model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is proposed to generate a valid model, followed by path analysis with latent variables to evaluate the structural equation modeling (SEM). The result provides the conceptual model with impact factors and their correlations. The goodness of fit value is acceptable for the agreed-upon condition, as well as a descriptive that incorporates Industry 4.0 and ESG in terms of business, industry, and ESG in relation to the energy sector’s key issues.","Digital Transformation; Energy Sector; Esg; Industry 4.0; Sustainable Development; Economic Growth; Factor Analysis; Industrial Technology; Machine Learning; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","economic growth; factor analysis; industrial technology; machine learning; sustainability; sustainable development","","Shaaban, Mostafa, Selection of sustainable development indicators for the assessment of electricity production in Egypt, Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, 22, pp. 65-73, (2017); Emissions Gap Report 2012, (2013); Future of Energy in World Economic Forum Strategic Intelligence, (2020); Wollschlaeger, Martin, The future of industrial communication: Automation networks in the era of the internet of things and industry 4.0, IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine, 11, 1, pp. 17-27, (2017); Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4 0, (2013); Hermann, Mario, Design principles for industrie 4.0 scenarios, Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2016-March, pp. 3928-3937, (2016); Wang, Shiyong, Implementing Smart Factory of Industrie 4.0: An Outlook, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2016, (2016); Liao, Yongxin, Past, present and future of Industry 4.0 - a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 12, pp. 3609-3629, (2017); MIT Sloan Management Review, (2014); Hinings, Bob R.B.H., Digital innovation and transformation: An institutional perspective, Information and Organization, 28, 1, pp. 52-61, (2018)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137195440"

However, from the perspective of day-To-day work, for those engaged in designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems identifying relevant guidelines and translating them into practice presents a challenge. The aim of this paper is to help anyone engaged in building a responsible AI system by identifying an indicative long-list of potential stakeholders. This list of impacted stakeholders is intended to enable such AI system builders to decide which guidelines are most suited to their practice. The paper draws on a literature review of articles short-listed based on searches conducted in the ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar. The findings are based on content analysis of the short-listed literature guided by probes which draw on the ISO 26000:2010 Guidance on social responsibility. The paper identifies three levels of potentially relevant stakeholders when responsible AI systems are considered: individual stakeholders (including users, developers, and researchers), organisational stakeholders, and national / international stakeholders engaged in making laws, rules, and regulations. The main intended audience for this paper is software, requirements, and product engineers engaged in building AI systems. In addition, business executives, policy makers, legal/regulatory experts, AI researchers, public, private, and third sector organisations developing responsible AI guidelines, and anyone interested in seeing functional responsible AI systems are the other intended audience for this paper.","Ai Ethics; Ai System Builders; Corporate Social Responsibility; Iso 26000:2010 Guidance On Social Responsibility; Responsible Ai Systems; Stakeholder Identification; Economic And Social Effects; Ethical Technology; Laws And Legislation; Social Aspects; Ai Ethic; Ai System Builder; Ai Systems; Corporate Social Responsibility; Iso 26000:2010 Guidance On Social Responsibility; Responsible Ai System; Social Responsibilities; Stakeholders Identifications; System Builders; Digital Libraries","Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Laws and legislation; Social aspects; AI ethic; AI system builder; AI systems; Corporate social responsibility; ISO 26000:2010 guidance on social responsibility; Responsible AI system; Social responsibilities; Stakeholders identifications; System builders; Digital libraries","","Abdalla, Mohamed, The Grey Hoodie Project: Big Tobacco, Big Tech, and the Threat on Academic Integrity, pp. 287-297, (2021); Harvard Business Review, (2017); Algorithmwatch Retrieved March 1 2022 from; Amershi, Saleema, Guidelines for human-AI interaction, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2019); Role of Cooperation in Responsible AI Development, (2019); Association for Computing Machinery, (2018); Barclay, Iain, Identifying Roles, Requirements and Responsibilitiesin Trustworthy AI Systems, pp. 264-271, (2021); AI Fairness 360 an Extensible Toolkit for Detecting Understanding and Mitigating Unwanted Algorithmic Bias, (2018); 2019 Responsible AI by Design in Practice; AI Matters, (2019)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","9781450392471","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137153372"

However, the monitoring of physiologic signals in real-time prompts concerns about benefit and risk, ownership of such digital data, data transfer privacy, and the discovery and disclosure of signals of possible health significance. Here we explore the perceptions and perspectives of employers and employees about key ethical considerations regarding the potential use of sensors in the workplace. Methods: We distributed a survey developed and refined based on key research questions and past literature to a wide range and size of industries in British Columbia, Canada. Both employers (potential Implementers) and employees (potential Users) were invited to participate. Results: We received 344 survey responses. Most responses were from construction, healthcare, education, government, and utilities sectors. Across genders, industries, and workplace sizes, we found a convergence of opinions on perceived benefit and concern between potential Implementers and potential Users regarding the motivation to use biosensors in the workplace. Potential Implementers and Users also agreed on issues pertaining to safety, privacy, disclosure of findings of possible medical significance, risks, data ownership, data sharing, and transfer of data between workplaces. The greatest variability between potential Users and Implementers pertained to data ownership. Conclusion: Strong agreement in the perception of biosensor use in the workplace between potential Implementers and Users reflects shared interest, motivation, and responsibility for their use. The use of sensors is rapidly increasing, and transparency about key use factors–both practical and ethical–is essential to maintain the current and desirable level of solidarity.","Biosensor; Corporate Ethics; Occupational Safety; Survey; Wearable Electronic Devices; Wearable Sensor; Workplace Sensor; Adult; Aged; Article; British Columbia; Canada; Controlled Study; Data Privacy; Educational Status; Employee; Employer; Evidence Based Practice; Female; Gender; Government; Health Care; Health Survey; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Occupational Safety; Organization And Management; Perception; Sample Size; Social Participation; Workplace","adult; aged; Article; British Columbia; Canada; controlled study; data privacy; educational status; employee; employer; evidence based practice; female; gender; government; health care; health survey; human; male; middle aged; motivation; occupational safety; organization and management; perception; sample size; social participation; workplace","We thank Technical Safety BC and WorkSafe BC for funding this work through contracts to JI.","Moore, Phoebe V., Regulating wellbeing in the brave new quantified workplace, Employee Relations, 39, 3, pp. 308-316, (2017); Ajunwa, Ifeoma, Limitless worker surveillance, California Law Review, 105, 3, pp. 735-776, (2017); Coates McCall, Iris, Owning Ethical Innovation: Claims about Commercial Wearable Brain Technologies, Neuron, 102, 4, pp. 728-731, (2019); Minielly, Nicole C., Privacy Challenges to the Democratization of Brain Data, iScience, 23, 6, (2020); Ethical Dimensions of Commercial and Diy Neurotechnologies, (2020); Guitar, Nicole A., Fitbit Activity Trackers Interrupt Workplace Sedentary Behavior: A New Application, Workplace Health and Safety, 66, 5, pp. 218-222, (2018); Zaltieri, Martina, A wearable device based on a fiber bragg grating sensor for low back movements monitoring, Sensors, 20, 14, pp. 1-15, (2020); Asadi, Hamed, Continuous, integrated sensors for predicting fatigue during non-repetitive work: demonstration of technique in the operating room, Ergonomics, 64, 9, pp. 1160-1173, (2021); Maltseva, Kateryna, Wearables in the workplace: The brave new world of employee engagement, Business Horizons, 63, 4, pp. 493-505, (2020); Organizational Neuroethics, (2020)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","2673253X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134368389"

These new paradigms enable novel approaches like distributed and collaborative manufacturing. Manufacturers increasingly leverage digital technologies, such as 3D printing, cloud manufacturing and artificial intelligence, to provide customised products. Digital technologies also improve predictive and preventive maintenance on the shop floor and across the supply chain, increasing the overall resilience of manufacturing industries in times of crisis. This article proposes a blueprint of a collaborative, decentralised approach to human rights due diligence in digital supply chains. It argues that the pooling of human rights due diligence efforts in manufacturing industries could have network-wide effects of incentivising value chain actors to also collaborate on providing collective remedy.","Collaborative Due Diligence; Human Rights; Industry 4.0; Smart Manufacturing","","","Aho, Brett, Beyond surveillance capitalism: Privacy, regulation and big data in Europe and China, Economy and Society, 49, 2, pp. 187-212, (2020); Alcácer, V., Scanning the Industry 4.0: A Literature Review on Technologies for Manufacturing Systems, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 22, 3, pp. 899-919, (2019); Judgment 2007 Icj Reports, (2007); Baines, Tim S., The servitization of manufacturing: A review of literature and reflection on future challenges, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 20, 5, pp. 547-567, (2009); undefined, (2021); Bonnitcha, Jonathan, The concept of 'due diligence' in the UN Guiding Principles on business and Human Rights, European Journal of International Law, 28, 3, pp. 899-919, (2017); Bonnitcha, Jonathan, The concept of 'due diligence' in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: A rejoinder to John Gerard Ruggie and John F.

These aspirations are often coupled with a focus on responsibility, ethics and transparency, as well as emergent forms of regulation that seek to set demands for corporate conduct and the protection of civic rights. And the Protective measures include methods of traceability and assessments of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ datasets and algorithms that are considered to be traceable, stable and contained. However, these ways of thinking about both technology and ethics obscure a fundamental issue, namely that machine learning systems entangle data, algorithms and more-than-human environments in ways that challenge a well-defined separation. This article investigates the fundamental fallacy of most data reuse strategies as well as their regulation and mitigation strategies that data can somehow be followed, contained and controlled in machine learning processes. Instead, the article argues that we need to understand the reuse of data as an inherently entangled phenomenon. To examine this tension between the discursive regimes and the realities of data reuse, we advance the notion of reuse entanglements as an analytical lens. The main contribution of the article is the conceptualization of reuse that places entanglements at its core and the articulation of its relevance using empirical illustrations. This is important, we argue, for our understanding of the nature of data and algorithms, for the practical uses of data and algorithms and our attitudes regarding ethics, responsibility and regulation.","Algorithms; Data Reuse; Datasets; Entanglements; Ethics; Machine Learning; Ethical Technology; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Corporate Strategies; Data Reuse; Dataset; Entanglement; Key Elements; Machine Learning Systems; Machine-learning; On-machines; Policy Discussion; Reuse; Machine Learning","Ethical technology; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Corporate strategies; Data reuse; Dataset; Entanglement; Key elements; Machine learning systems; Machine-learning; On-machines; Policy discussion; Reuse; Machine learning","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Independent Research Fund Denmark grant \u201CAI REUSE\u201D and the ERC Advanced Grant \u201CAlgorithmic Societies: Ethical Life in the Age of Machine Learning\u201D for supporting their research.

However, the rapidly emerging financial technology (FinTech) sector still presents an HR challenge. Southeast Asia, which accounts for the highest adoption rate of mobile banking, has set new records regarding the number of transactions, as well as funding amount, in recent years. Moreover, borderless financial cooperation, coupled with in-demand tech talents, will rapidly boost the development of the region. Thus, this study explored the new opportunities as well as challenges of a new business model, FinTech, in Southeast Asia’s banking and enterprise sector in the post-COVID-19 era. It also examined how organizations can achieve sustainable development via the interaction of the new operating model with existing ones by developing relevant strategies in the context of the “new normal” working condition. By reviewing the literature on HR management (HRM), we proposed how banking and FinTech companies could supply tech talent with the relevant experience or engage in training projects before recruiting. Additionally, since organizations desire sustainability-minded employees, they offer flexible working arrangements and well-established reward policies that can create remote work performance and retention rates. Being committed to upskilling and reskilling global talent by offering talent mobility opportunities across the organization, as well as by fully embracing the creation of value for cross-cultural talent, companies can support their employees’ long-term career goals and maintain competitive strength. Finally, organizations must focus more on flexible adjustments and cross-domain communication for global talent. Forming strategic alliances with FinTech companies would be an alternative conduit that can ensure that regional laws comply with the local culture and national law, for bias and conflict reduction.","Business Integration; Digital Finance; Fintech; Human Resource; Southeast Asia; Sustainable Development","","","International Conference on Management and Industrial Engineering, (2013); Aguinis, Herman, Talent management challenges during COVID-19 and beyond: Performance management to the rescue, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 24, 3, pp. 233-240, (2021); Al-Musali, Mahfoudh Abdulkarem, Cross-country comparison of intellectual capital performance and its impact on financial performance of commercial banks in GCC countries, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 9, 4, pp. 512-531, (2016); Albukhitan, Saeed, Developing Digital Transformation Strategy for Manufacturing, Procedia Computer Science, 170, pp. 664-671, (2020); Surveying the Covid 19 Pandemic and Its Implications, (2020); AlQershi, Nagwan Abdulwahab, The effect of talent management and human capital on sustainable business performance: an empirical investigation in Malaysian hospitals, International Journal of Ethics and Systems, 38, 2, pp. 316-337, (2022); Research Anthology on Human Resource Practices for the Modern Workforce, (2022); Arner, Douglas W., Sustainability, FinTech and Financial Inclusion, European Business Organization Law Review, 21, 1, pp. 7-35, (2020); Ayadi, Mohamed A., Senior official speech attributes and foreign exchange risk around business cycles, International Review of Financial Analysis, 80, (2022); Always on Business, (2022)","","MDPI","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137291723"

However, emerging evidence suggests disaffection toward e-health systems. There is an urgency to narrow down on factors that can improve intentions to use e-health apps/platforms that drive e-health systems to feed into the design and implementation of health management interventions. This paper contributes in this regard by exploring how resources of individuals' (value systems and information technology traits (i.e., microcomputer playfulness and IT innovativeness) and firms' (i.e., Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR]) influence e-health apps/platforms usage intentions. Using dispositional traits and human values theories, we tested the research hypotheses with data (N = 604) from users and prospective users of e-health platforms/apps in Ghana.

The social pillar of sustainability has then been unnoticed, favouring the more regularly discussed environmental and economic dimensions. This study aims to expand the social sustainability framework to investigate the impact of sustainable social supply chain practices on firm social performance. The electronic survey was conducted on firms that adopted sustainable social practices. The 144 data sets were received from manufacturing firms. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling with PLS-SEM to examine domains and outcomes of sustainable supply chain practices. The result found that social supply chain practices impact the firm's social performance. However, the results indicate that the social element of sustainable procurement does not affect the firm social performance. The results show social fairness challenged manufacturing firms to comply with sustainable production and distribution. Most manufacturing firms are still not aware of their role and social responsibility to develop the local suppliers and community. Sustainability framework has proposed to raise awareness of sustainable practices that drive firms to implement sustainable social supply chain practices and leverage social performance. By being socially responsible, firms can gain improved brand awareness, a favourable corporate reputation, increased sales, observed firm growth and enhanced customer loyalty.","Distribution And Production; Social Performance; Sustainable Design; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Social Supply Chain; Developing Countries; Digital Storage; Ecodesign; Economic And Social Effects; Manufacture; Product Design; Social Aspects; Supply Chains; Child Labor; Distribution And Production; Living Conditions; Manufacturing Firms; Performance Frameworks; Social Performance; Social Sustainability; Supply Chain Practices; Sustainability Issues; Sustainable Social Supply Chain; Sustainable Development","Developing countries; Digital storage; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Product design; Social aspects; Supply chains; Child labor; Distribution and production; Living conditions; Manufacturing firms; Performance frameworks; Social performance; Social sustainability; Supply chain practices; Sustainability issues; Sustainable social supply chain; Sustainable development","The authors would like to thank the Division of Research and Innovation at Universiti Malaysia Pahang for funding this study ( RDU212701 ; UIC211502 ; PDU203220 ; PGRS190365 ).","Agyabeng-Mensah, Yaw, The role of green logistics management practices, supply chain traceability and logistics ecocentricity in sustainability performance, International Journal of Logistics Management, 32, 2, pp. 538-566, (2020); Affolderbach, Julia, Translating green economy concepts into practice: ideas pitches as learning tools for sustainability education, Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 46, 1, pp. 43-60, (2022); Ashenbaum, Bryan, Purchasing-logistics integration and supplier performance: An information-processing view, International Journal of Logistics Management, 28, 2, pp. 379-397, (2017); Ayton, Julie, Corporate social performance and financial risk: Further empirical evidence using higher frequency data, International Review of Financial Analysis, 80, (2022); Awasthy, Prakash, Responsible sourcing by improving workplace safety through buyer–supplier collaboration, European Journal of Operational Research, 274, 1, pp. 155-164, (2019); Baah, Charles, Examining the correlations between stakeholder pressures, green production practices, firm reputation, environmental and financial performance: Evidence from manufacturing SMEs, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 100-114, (2021); Bachiller, Patricia, Corporate governance in Spanish savings banks and its relationship with financial and social performance, Management Decision, 56, 4, pp. 828-848, (2018); Essays, (2025); Blanc, Florentin, From OSH regulation to safety results: Using behavioral insights and a “supply chain” approach to improve outcomes – The experience of the health and safety Executive, Safety Science, 145, (2022); Carter, Craig R., THE ROLE OF PURCHASING IN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: A STRUCTURAL EQUATION ANALYSIS, Journal of Business Logistics, 25, 1, pp. 145-186, (2004)","","Elsevier B.V.","23525509","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129248800"

Financial technology, formed by combining digital technology with traditional financial services, is gradually changing the financial service model and providing new ideas for corporate investment and financing. In this study, using the data of non-financial and non-real estate listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, A-shares from 2015 to 2020, we examine the effect of financial technology on corporate innovation through a fixed-effects model and investigate the influence of corporate characteristics on the relationship between financial technology and innovation through a moderating-effects model. The results show that financial technology enhances the ability to serve real enterprises by reshaping financial services, which in turn effectively drives an increase in corporate innovation, and the mechanism is conditionally heterogeneous. In addition, the moderating effect of the firm’s nature is found to be more significant in non-state-owned firms, high-technology firms, and firms in the growth and maturity stages by life cycle. The policy implications of this study are to continuously promote theoretical research, to guide the development of fintech, and to improve the construction of financial technology infrastructure. Additionally, to deepen the integration of financial technology with real enterprises and establish differentiated financial technology support tools, so as to improve the pre-cision of promoting enterprise innovation.","Corporate Innovation; Financial Technology; High-tech Enterprises; Life Cycle; State-owned Enterprises; Corporate Social Responsibility; Finance; High Technology Industry; Industrial Development; Industrial Policy; Innovation; Investment; Life Cycle Analysis; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","corporate social responsibility; finance; high technology industry; industrial development; industrial policy; innovation; investment; life cycle analysis; China; Guangdong; Shanghai; Shenzhen","Financial technology is a new financial services business model formed by the transformation of modern scientific and technological achievements to innovate the business model and business processes of financial products [12,13], which has great potential in terms of financial services industry profits, regulators’ earnings, and consumers’ welfare [14]. In recent years, with the development of advanced technologies such as big data, cloud computing, and blockchain, the emergence of “finance + technology” (fintech) has provided new ideas for corporate financing [15]. By integrating the abovementioned technological means and combining the business concept of sharing economy, fintech has developed two terminal application models, namely, fintech crowdfunding financing and financial technology lending financing, which present several advantages, such as wide funding channels, full range of financing, and high service quality [16–18], which have a profound impact on alleviating financing constraints and enhancing enterprises’ financial stability. Financial technology can enable financial institutions to enhance information identification and screening of enterprises, provide financial support to enterprises with innovative potential, avoid financial mismatches, and improve the efficiency of credit fund usage. Moreover, a digital financial system can provide investors with more information about the current market conditions and industry prospects of investment projects, reducing the cost of information identification for investors and enhancing their willingness to invest [11,13]. As a new product formed by the way of traditional finance and technology enablement, digital finance supported by financial technology can effectively reduce financing costs, lower the financial risks of enterprises, and provide a sustainable and stable economic foundation for technological innovation of micro enterprises by continuously optimizing financial services, breaking down information barriers, and providing personalized products [19]. Digital finance supported by financial technology, as a new product formed by traditional finance through a technology-enabled approach, has a significant impact on the technological innovation of micro enterprises. The development of China’s fintech industry started late. However, with its rapid development speed, China’s financial technology development level has been ranked among the top in the world. According to the “2020 Global financial technology Index Report” published by Findexable, China ranks 21st in the world in overall financial technology strength, while the ranking of companies engaged in financial services as Internet companies shows that Chinese financial technology companies are ranked first in the world in terms of overall strength, with Ant Financial, Jingdong Digital, and Du Xiaoman Financial ranking 1st, 3rd, and 6th, respectively [20,21]. In view of China’s leading position in the world’s financial technology development scale and technology practice, under the general trend of the rapid development of big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other technologies, an in-depth study on financial technology-driven corporate innovation has strong practical value and inspiring significance from a multidisciplinary-cum-intersectional research perspective.","Romer, Paul M., Endogenous technological change, Journal of Political Economy, 98, 5, pp. S71-S102, (1990); Csedő, Zoltán, Dynamic Corporate Governance, Innovation, and Sustainability: Post-COVID Period, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 6, (2022); Ma, Ding, Innovation diffusion enabler or barrier: An investigation of international patenting based on temporal exponential random graph models, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); J Asian Financ Econ Bus, (2022); Chen, Sheng-Syan, Voluntary disclosure and corporate innovation, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 58, 3, pp. 1081-1115, (2022); Yang, Daoguang, Earnings guidance: market pressure or corporate governance?

Results showed that over two thirds of posts are attached with hashtags, in particular when posts are oriented thematically towards PRODUCT and SERVICE; one third with metaphorical hashtags mostly involving WAR and ANIMATE metaphors, in particular when posts are oriented thematically towards CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, SERVICE and LIFE. Moreover, posts with hashtag use could be more significantly engaging than posts without it, and posts with ANIMATE metaphor hashtags tend to be more engaging, though there is no difference in the engagement between posts with metaphorical hashtags and posts without them. Taken together, these results suggest that hashtag use and ANIMATE metaphors in Weibo posts can effectively enhance audience engagement. The findings will be of interest for digital marketing practitioners to use hashtags in Weibo posts more strategically.","Engagement; Hashtag; Metaphor; Thematic Orientation; Weibo Posts","","This study was supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education, China (Grant Number: 21YJA740035 ).","Abulaish, Muhammad, A survey of figurative language and its computational detection in online social networks, ACM Transactions on the Web, 14, 1, (2020); Androutsopoulos, Jannis K., Introduction: Sociolinguistics and computer-mediated communication, Journal of Sociolinguistics, 10, 4, pp. 419-438, (2006); Barklamb, Amy M., Learning the language of social media: A comparison of engagement metrics and social media strategies used by food and nutrition-related social media accounts, Nutrients, 12, 9, pp. 1-23, (2020); Bazarova, Natalya Natalie, Managing Impressions and Relationships on Facebook: Self-Presentational and Relational Concerns Revealed Through the Analysis of Language Style, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 32, 2, pp. 121-141, (2013); Bonsón, Enrique, Corporate twitter use and stakeholder engagement: An empirical analysis of the Spanish hotel industry, European Journal of Tourism Research, 13, pp. 69-83, (2016); Bouvier, Gwen, What gets lost in Twitter ‘cancel culture’ hashtags?

However, the major problem is associated with the lack of CSR policies, development and adaptation of green marketing in the companies operating in manufacturing companies in the UK. In this manner, this study aimed to determine the role of digital marketing, CSR policies and green marketing in brand development. Concerning this, the case of UK’s manufacturing companies was considered which can help the manufacturing companies operating in the UK to make the development of brand more effective, as the consumers would perceive the brand which complies with the environmental laws. To attain the aim, the researchers utilized a quantitative method of data collection where a close-ended survey questionnaire was utilized. The data was collected from the concerned participants working in the manufacturing sector of the UK and the sample size considered for the analysis was based on 404 participants. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) on Smart PLS. The analysis revealed that the overall impact of green marketing, CSR policy and digital marketing was statistically significant on the brand development of UK’s manufacturing companies. Considering this, it has been recommended to the manufacturing companies in the UK to focus on environmental disclosure, green innovation, green alliance and promotional activity for the purpose of ensuring brand development. However, this study is limited to the geographical bounds of the UK; therefore, it has a certain room for future research.","Brand Development; Csr Policy; Digital Marketing; Green Marketing; Manufacturing Companies; Uk","","","Journal of Consumer Marketing, (2020); International Journal of Supply Chain Management, (2020); Test Engineering and Management, (2020); Int J of Business Innovation and Research, (2025); Test Engineering and Management, (2020); International Journal of Information and Coding Theory, (2013); Al-Hawary, Sulieman Ibraheem Shelash, Does mobile marketing affect customer loyalty in Jordan?, International Journal of Business Excellence, 23, 2, pp. 226-250, (2021); Alolayyan, Main Naser, Banking service quality provided by commercial banks and customer satisfaction.

However, traditional finance faces obstacles in supporting these innovations, and it is unclear how this dilemma can be solved. This paper seeks new solutions using digital finance to solve this dilemma. Using panel data on listed companies and cities in China, this paper analyzes the impact of digital finance on green technology innovation. The results show that (1) digital finance significantly promotes green technology innovation, and this finding holds even through serial robustness tests. The promotion effects are attributed to a reduction in corporate financing constraints, industrial structure upgrading and manufacturing development. (2) Digital financial development has a greater positive effect on green technology innovation in small-scale enterprises. Digital financial development can better promote green technology innovation in regions with higher pollutant emission intensity and where local government has stronger governance capacity. In addition, manufacturing and nonstate economic development help to better exploit the green technology innovation effect of digital finance. (3) With the improvement of environmental decentralization, digital finance strongly promotes green technology innovation, indicating that the downward trend of environmental responsibility will better alleviate the mismatch between the supply and demand of green innovation investments. In order to strengthen enterprises' green technology innovation capacity and solve serious environmental pollution problems, it is suggested that traditional financial institutions should actively embrace this digital trend. Meanwhile, government should develop differentiated innovation incentive policies to increase the technological innovation investment of manufacturing and private enterprises while also promoting the reform of the environmental decentralization system and strengthening supervision of central environmental protections.","Digital Finance; Environmental Decentralization; Financing Constraints; Green Technology Innovation; Decentralization; Digitization; Finance; Innovation; Panel Data; Sustainability; China","decentralization; digitization; finance; innovation; panel data; sustainability; China","","Arranz, Nieves, How do internal, market and institutional factors affect the development of eco-innovation in firms?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 297, (2021); Beck, Thorsten, Small and medium-size enterprises: Access to finance as a growth constraint, Journal of Banking and Finance, 30, 11, pp. 2931-2943, (2006); Blampied, Nicolás, Economic growth, environmental constraints and convergence: The declining growth premium for developing economies, Ecological Economics, 181, (2021); Cai, Xiang, Can direct environmental regulation promote green technology innovation in heavily polluting industries?

The aim of the present study was to explore the motivations, facilitators, and barriers to its implementation. In-depth individual interviews (n = 11) were conducted with professionals involved in the conceptualization, development, artistic vision, and implementation of the initiative. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: (1) CVS's perception that the campaign as a good fit; (2) the marketing of “empowerment” to generate profit as well as a desired outcome; and (3) desire to exemplify a value-driven company model and contribute sustainably to broader values such as diversity and body positivity.

The author studied the way in which two factors that are representative of institutional pressures in the real estate sector – namely, “ecology” and “digital innovation” – were incorporated into the BSC causal chains. Design/methodology/approach: The author’s methodology is that of action research. To analyze the balance of indicators between short and long term, the author classified the companies according to their strategic acuity, i.e. their ability to balance an organizational vision (near vision) and an environmental one (distance vision) when choosing their performance indicators. This resulted in a company classification with three categories: emmetropic, hypermetropic and slightly myopic. Findings: This research enabled to observe that the selected ecological indicators in BSCs derive mainly from coercive institutional pressure. Hence, in companies with fewer legal requirements in ecological matters, the selected ecological indicators are included in the BSC causal chain, in that they are used as a commercial argument with a view to improving financial performance. These results are similar to the reactionary and reputational perspectives of the sustainability business case. With regard to the incorporation of digital innovation indicators into BSCs, the author found that the companies that have the most digital innovation indicators are those that mobilize the most ecological indicators. Digital innovation indicators are part of the companies’ internal process perspective and are linked to organizational learning indicators. These results are similar to the responsible and collaborative perspectives of the sustainability business case. The author also found that the companies incorporate digital indicators into their BSCs by institutional mimicry insofar as the selected indicators are not always consistent with a strategic rationale but are chosen by copying what is done in other companies. Research limitations/implications: The author’s research has two main limitations related to the methodology used. On the one hand, the mobilization of part-time management students to have access to companies can influence the emergence of mimetic isomorphisms. Indeed, these students follow the same training and advise the companies that welcome them according to the training they have followed. On the other hand, the author’s research stops at the development of the BSC. The author does not study the impacts or changes that occurred after the implementation of the tool. This could be the subject of future research on the appropriation and use of the BSC by the company’s actors and their impact on the optimization of global performance measurement system. Practical implications: This study may be of interest to researchers and managers who wish to reconcile sustainable development and digital innovation in global performance management. It analyzes the impact of institutional pressures on the performance measurement system. It offers insights on how to integrate ecological indicators and digital innovation indicators into the BSC causal chains. It identifies the tensions that managers may face. It reports on practices adopted in the field by managers in action. Social implications: This paper reveals the feasibility of measuring global performance integrating ecology and digital innovation. It responds to a preoccupation of recent years in academic research on how to reconcile corporate social responsibility and technological innovation. It shows that the companies that have the most digital innovation indicators are those that mobilize the most ecological indicators. However, it highlights the difficulties encountered by managers in the field when faced with institutional pressures. Originality/value: The author’s reflection is in line with the literature of recent years that reconciles sustainable development and innovation. The author studied how “ecology” and “digital innovation” are incorporated into the BSC causal chains. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first time this type of study has been conducted in the literature.","Bsc; Digital Innovation; Ecology; Performance Indicators; Real Estate","","","Abrahamson, Eric, Management fashion: Lifecycles, triggers, and collective learning processes, Administrative Science Quarterly, 44, 4, pp. 708-740, (1999); Technology and the Future of Work, (1992); Adler, Paul S., Portrait of the relationship between mechanization and work in the U.S. economy, International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 5, 4, pp. 345-375, (1995); Usability Turning Technologies into Tools, (1992); Altrichter, Herbert, The concept of action research, Learning Organization, 9, 3, pp. 125-131, (2002); Anser, Muhammad Khalid, Moderating effect of innovation on corporate social responsibility and firm performance in realm of sustainable development, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 5, pp. 799-806, (2018); Antonsen, Yngve, The downside of the Balanced Scorecard: A case study from Norway, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 30, 1, pp. 40-50, (2014); Antonsen, Yngve, Too rich to learn–when action researchers work against senior management and their use of performance management, Educational Action Research, 30, 1, pp. 140-157, (2022); Apprentissage Organisationnel Theorie Methode Pratique, (2002); Journal of Management Accounting Research, (1997)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","2040803X; 20408021","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130676087"

But any business management option has to be grounded in a true awareness or belief that it will be a suitable and appropriate choice. In this belief the personal values of those who have the power to lead the way to weigh heavily. In this sense, there are personal values that, when used as guidelines in the management of a company, seem to promote the happiness of employees in the work environment. The purpose of this paper is to find the personal values of the entrepreneur. As a secondary objective, the authors also study whether these values are associated with certain entrepreneurs’ socio-demographic factors (gender and age). Design/methodology/approach: The group to be studied is the Spanish business community. An exploratory study is carried out, first, with the definition of value constructs according to Schwartz’s personal values model and, second, with a relational analysis, measuring association effects through logistic regression. Findings: Two higher-order personal values of the entrepreneur are found that seem to contain all the elements that would lead to management styles that would facilitate happiness at work. These values emerge from a dimension model of Schwartz’s theory of basic human values. MVP which, however, does not follow its four adjacent/antagonistic dimensions, but is composed of three dimensions adjacent to each other and, therefore, complementary. Moreover, some stereotypes in the literature on the relationships between personal values and certain socio-demographic factors are broken down and their effects on happiness at work are revealed. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this work is the relatively small sample size. In this sense, it would be useful to check whether the overall results are repeated in larger samples. Another limitation is that this is a portrait of the group at a given time. Given the experimental nature of this type of work, especially in the case of socio-demographic factors, it would be advisable to carry out a follow-up longitudinal analysis with a time horizon. This would allow a more precise investigation of the effects of the variables mentioned above. In addition, a third limitation is that the authors are studying the collective of Spanish entrepreneurs, and in the study of personal values, culture has a determining influence (Schenck, 2016; Boer and Boehnke, 2016; Perozo and Paz, 2016). It would also be worthwhile considering this study by sector: are the values the same for entrepreneurs in different sectors?; or in some specific sectors, for example, are there differences between entrepreneurs with tech businesses versus non-tech businesses or those who make the circular economy or the green economy a guideline for their organizations? Thus, technology companies must be open to change. Openness and innovation are for their entrepreneurs’ key values to ensure their performance (Tseng, 2010; Van Auken et al., 2008). However, in these organizations, there is a framework of conflicting values between the required flexibility and the values of power and control that the entrepreneur needs, and wants, to have (Albarracín et al., 2014). On the other hand, personal values determine green self-identity and moderate its relationships with ecological care and the moral obligation of the entrepreneur (Blankenberg and Alhusen, 2019; Barbarossa et al., 2017). Therefore, it could be analysed whether these values are maintained in entrepreneurs in these sectors, influencing, as discussed in this paper, greater happiness in the work context; and whether they are conditioned by gender or age (Fotieva, 2021; Li et al., 2020). It would also be helpful to study the socio-demographic influence further, to analyse the possibility of interaction or confounding effects between socio-demographic variables and some other variables not addressed in this paper. For example, does purchasing power or income level, affect personal values? And do the values that give content to F2, power and control, lead the entrepreneur to a higher level of income level or vice versa? Do other factors play a role? In fact, for Hirigoyen (2008), values such as altruism, benevolence and universalism are considered as obstacles to the development of the company. Subsequently, authors such as Salas-Vallina (2018) and Boubakary (2015) conclude that far from that idea, these axiological elements would lead to more significant business development through the satisfaction and happiness they generate in employees and stimulate their productivity, matching with the conclusions. It would be interesting, as a complement to the approach of this work, to carry out a study on the happiness at work of the entrepreneur’s employees, being the group of employees surveyed. Knowing the profile of values of an entrepreneur through the scale proposed in this work, it would be possible to analyse whether this is associated with greater or lesser perceived happiness among his/her employees. As mentioned above, from the methodological point of view, a risk of using the multidimensional scaling modelling for the analysis of personal values is that the respondent reflects more what he/she considers socially desirable than his/her true perception. This bias is one of the main limitations of psychological research. However, the fact that European Statistical Office surveys are guided by experts, both in processing -knowing how to deal with social desirability in personal values research (Danioni and Barni, 2020) – and in data collection, eliminates this limitation. Practical implications: However, despite the above limitations, this paper makes important contributions. On the one hand, at a theoretical and instrumental level, it shows that the higher-order values graph of Spanish entrepreneurs follows the circumplex essence of the Schwartz value model but does not obey its number of higher-order dimensions. In the case of entrepreneurs, it consists of three elements, three dimensions, adjacent and complementary. None of them contradicts any other. A methodology is created to portray the Spanish entrepreneur in an axiological way and, from this portrait, to reveal his/her tendency towards a leadership style that promotes the happiness of his/her employees, through the importance given to these three factors or dimensions. These dimensions are weighted, in turn, by issues such as gender or age group. For added practical purposes, this information would be beneficial, in the first place, for all those who want to work in and with a particular entrepreneur. The type of leadership or management expected is a factor or reason why a person decides where he/she would like to work (Qing et al., 2020; Lee, 2016). This is not only for the potential employees of that business but also for all those groups or stakeholders, who engage with the company to perform their functions. Individuals make important decisions and choices about their relationships in the work environment based on the alignment of their values with those of the party they want to engage with (Sagiv et al., 2015). On the other hand, it can serve entrepreneurship educators. By knowing the value factors of entrepreneurs, adjusted to the culture of the particular territory, they will be able to pass on this information to their entrepreneurship students (Karimi and Makreet, 2020; Arieli and Tenne-Gazit, 2017) and teach them how they could increase the happiness at work. It also serves to better understand the constructs of management values-employee engagement-workplace happiness in the current environment (Ravina-Ripoll et al., 2020; Salas-Vallina et al., 2017; Wang and Yang, 2016), by introducing the role of personal values on the entrepreneur’s governance style into this construct (Figure 1). Social implications: Finally, this study can also have social implications, making its tiny contribution to the SDGs through the study of personal values that guide the behaviour of the entrepreneur. The decision by international institutions for countries to implement the sustainable development goals (SDGs) (UNSDG 2030 Agenda) as cross-cutting strands of their policies has boosted the idea of addressing happiness at work. Thus, SDG 8 talks about Decent Work. In addition to the priority of improving the conditions of groups living in discriminatory working environments (child labour, poverty, precariousness, etc.), taken to its maximum expression, this objective encompasses much more. Workers spend a large part of their lives at work. At the same time, a business needs its employees to be productive. SDG 8 aims to ensure that people have quality employment, increasing their productivity and consumption potential. On the other hand, SDG 3 is about “Health and Well-being”, i.e. ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages. It is also about health and well-being in the work environment. Issues such as interpersonal relationships at work, environment and teams, organizational culture, role in the organization, autonomy at work and fostering innovative spirit, can be factors that, if poorly managed, reduce the feeling or perception of happiness at work, especially in today’s digital world (Foncubierta-Rodríguez and Montero-Sánchez, 2019; Leka and Houdmont, 2010; Näswall et al., 2008). Originality/value: The role of certain higher-order personal values of the entrepreneur is highlighted, which could make him/her tend towards the realization of happiness management practices. Furthermore, through the methodology used, a model of the entrepreneur’s higher-order values has been established, which can be used as a tool to generate reasonable expectations about his/her way of governance and to what extent it is close to a framework conducive to happiness management. This information can be beneficial to all those people and groups that establish relationships with the company, from managers and employees to external stakeholders. In this way, it also helps to anticipate the companýs response to corporate social responsibility.","Age; Corporate Governance; Entrepreneurs; Gender; Happiness Management; Personal Values","","","Gálvez-Albarracín, Edgar Julián, Influence of information and communication technology on the performance of Colombian micro, small and medium enterprises, Estudios Gerenciales, 30, 133, pp. 355-364, (2014); Middle East Journal of Management, (2021); Amabile, Teresa M., Affect and creativity at work, Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, 3, pp. 367-403, (2005); Arieli, Sharon, Values and behavior in a work environment: Taking a multi-level perspective, pp. 115-141, (2017); Arslan, Muhammad, Examining the role of employee engagement in the relationship between organisational cynicism and employee performance, International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 39, 1-2, pp. 118-137, (2019); Avolio, Bruce J., Authentic leadership development: Getting to the root of positive forms of leadership, Leadership Quarterly, 16, 3, pp. 315-338, (2005); Baptiste, Nicole Renée, Tightening the link between employee wellbeing at work and performance: A new dimension for HRM, Management Decision, 46, 2, pp. 284-309, (2008); Barbarossa, Camilla, Personal Values, Green Self-identity and Electric Car Adoption, Ecological Economics, 140, pp. 190-200, (2017); Bashir, Mohsin, Akhuwat: Measuring Success for a Non-profit Organization, Asian Journal of Management Cases, 16, 1, pp. 100-112, (2019); Bass and Stogdill S Handbook of Leadership, (1990)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","14720701","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119018196"

Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in achieving DT. As DT is touching each sphere of humanity, AI led DT is raising many fundamental questions. These questions raise concerns for the systems deployed, how they should behave, what risks they carry, the monitoring and evaluation control we have in hand, etc. These issues call for the need to integrate ethics in AI led DT. The purpose of this study is to develop an “AI led ethical digital transformation framework”. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature survey, various existing business ethics decision-making models were synthesised. The authors mapped essential characteristics such as intensity and the individual, organisational and opportunity factors of ethics models with the proposed AI led ethical DT. The DT framework is evaluated using a thematic analysis of 23 expert interviews with relevant AI ethics personas from industry and society. The qualitative data of the interviews and opinion data has been analysed using MAXQDA software. Findings: The authors have explored how AI can drive the ethical DT framework and have identified the core constituents of developing an AI led ethical DT framework. Backed by established ethical theories, the paper presents how DT pillars are related and sequenced to ethical factors. This research provides the potential to examine theoretically sequenced ethical factors with practical DT pillars. Originality/value: The study establishes deduced and induced ethical value codes based on thematic analysis to develop guidelines for the pursuit of ethical DT. The authors identify four unique induced themes, namely, corporate social responsibility, perceived value, standard benchmarking and learning willingness. The comprehensive findings of this research, supported by a robust theoretical background, have substantial implications for academic research and corporate applicability. The proposed AI led ethical DT framework is unique and can be used for integrated social, technological and economic ethical research.","Ai Ethics; Artificial Intelligence (ai); Business Ethics; Digital Transformation; Ethical Decision-making Models; Maxqda","","","Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Aradau, Claudia, Governing others: Anomaly and the algorithmic subject of security, European Journal of International Security, 3, 1, pp. 1-21, (2018); Awad, Edmond, The Moral Machine experiment, Nature, 563, 7729, pp. 59-64, (2018); Baiyere, Abayomi, Digital transformation and the new logics of business process management, European Journal of Information Systems, 29, 3, pp. 238-259, (2020); Barn, Balbir S., Mapping the public debate on ethical concerns: algorithms in mainstream media, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, 18, 1, pp. 38-53, (2020); Bertino, Elisa, Data transparency with blockchain and AI ethics, Journal of Data and Information Quality, 11, 4, (2019); Towards A Code of Ethics for Artificial Intelligence, (2017); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence Forecasting Prevention and Mitigation, (2018); Bryson, Joanna J., Patiency is not a virtue: the design of intelligent systems and systems of ethics, Ethics and Information Technology, 20, 1, pp. 15-26, (2018)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","17588871; 1477996X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120477032"

This study examines the relationship between sustainability reporting practices and web-based communication practices in Italian universities. We employed a qualitative enquire and content analysis of the sustainability web pages of Italian public universities by analysing their content and updates and their relationship with their adoption of sustainability reporting. Our results suggest there are risks to web-based media being used to replace sustainability reporting, resulting in a deinstitutionalising effect for sustainability reporting.

However, the literature on the role of collaboration and coordination in a digitally enabled supply chain (SC) to achieve sustainability is still lacking. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain collaboration and coordination (SCC), sustainable development strategy (SDS), digital transformation (DIT), and collaborative advantages (COA) on sustainable supply chain firm performance (SSCFP).

This study utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze data collected from 361 respondents of the automotive industry in India. The findings show that SCC positively affects SDS and DIT. SDS positively affects DIT, COA, and DIT positively affects SSCFP. DIT fully mediates the relationship between SCC and COA. The study suggests that managers can apply SCC, SDS, and DIT in series to achieve sustainable performance. However, the COA can only be enhanced in the digitalized SC. The study provides empirical evidence to policymakers and practitioners for the synergy between SCC, SDS, DIT, and COA to achieve sustainable performance in the SC's manufacturing firm.","Collaborative Advantages; Digital Transformation; Supply Chain Collaboration And Coordination; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Sustainable Development Strategy; Sustainable Supply Chain Firm Performance; Conceptual Framework; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Numerical Model; Supply Chain Management; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Transaction Cost; India","conceptual framework; corporate social responsibility; digitization; numerical model; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; transaction cost; India","","Abdallah, Ayman Bahjat, The effect of supply chain quality management on supply chain performance: the indirect roles of supply chain agility and innovation, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 51, 7, pp. 785-812, (2021); Agrawal, Prakash, Analysis of barriers in implementation of digital transformation of supply chain using interpretive structural modelling approach, Journal of Modelling in Management, 15, 1, pp. 297-317, (2020); Agyabeng-Mensah, Yaw, Examining the influence of internal green supply chain practices, green human resource management and supply chain environmental cooperation on firm performance, Supply Chain Management, 25, 5, pp. 585-599, (2020); Bai, Chunguang, A supply chain transparency and sustainability technology appraisal model for blockchain technology, International Journal of Production Research, 58, 7, pp. 2142-2162, (2020); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barringer, Bruce R., Walking a tightrope: Creating value through interorganizational relationships, Journal of Management, 26, 3, pp. 367-403, (2000); Baryannis, George, Supply chain risk management and artificial intelligence: state of the art and future research directions, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 7, pp. 2179-2202, (2019); Belhadi, Amine, Artificial intelligence-driven innovation for enhancing supply chain resilience and performance under the effect of supply chain dynamism: an empirical investigation, Annals of Operations Research, 333, 2-3, pp. 627-652, (2024); Büyüközkan, Gülҫin, Digital Supply Chain: Literature review and a proposed framework for future research, Computers in Industry, 97, pp. 157-177, (2018); Calatayud, Agustina, The self-thinking supply chain, Supply Chain Management, 24, 1, pp. 22-38, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118104811"

Determining the drivers of digitalization of banking services based on the principles of corporate social responsibility of banks makes it possible to find a way out of the crisis. The objective of the study is to develop a model for clustering banks in terms of the level of digitalization on the principles of corporate social responsibility. In this study, a twofold model has been proposed: The first part includes the calculation of the level of digitalization of banking, and the second part includes mathematical simulation of the clustering of bank digitalization level. This study reveals new possible solutions to the digitalization of banking in the face of new threats. In particular, factor analysis identifies the main factors, cluster analysis ranks banks into three categories (A, B, C) of service digitalization, and a dendrogram identifies digitalization drivers.

In this situation, several universities worldwide have responded with digital methods and hybrid classes in a short period of time. The aim of this paper is to show how the universities have adapted teaching methods to digital platforms in the academic year 2020–2021. This case study is based on the experience of 37 postgraduate communication students in the course Business and Communication from a Communication Programme. The objective of this course was to promote the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in business following the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) of the United Nations. To do this, the students provided different solutions related to the SDGs and developed a communication strategy to inform and engage the stakeholders in the companies analyzed in a hybrid class. The results show that using this methodology and working in digital platforms, students have learned the importance of SDGs through implementing specific solutions linked to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Based on this analysis, they also developed a communication strategy showing how companies can improve society with specific actions through the lens of the SDG perspective.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr Communication; Digital Methods; Higher Education; Student-centred Learning; Sustainable Development Goals; Corporate Social Responsibility; Curriculum; Higher Education; Integrated Approach; Methodology; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Strategic Approach; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal; Teaching; United Nations","corporate social responsibility; curriculum; higher education; integrated approach; methodology; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; teaching; United Nations","I want to thank the students of the DCNT program of the academic year 2020– 2021 for the contributions made in their final project, through coherent proposals for the business contribution to the SDGs.","Chron High Educ, (2020); Experiential Learning Experience as the Source of Learning and Development, (1984); Bao, Wei, COVID-19 and online teaching in higher education: A case study of Peking University, Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, 2, 2, pp. 113-115, (2020); Zhu, Xudong, Education in and After Covid-19: Immediate Responses and Long-Term Visions, Postdigital Science and Education, 2, 3, pp. 695-699, (2020); Journal of Educational Technology Systems, (2020); Aucejo, Esteban M., The impact of COVID-19 on student experiences and expectations: Evidence from a survey, Journal of Public Economics, 191, (2020); Mededpublish, (2025); Blundell, Christopher N., Moving beyond enhancing pedagogies with digital technologies: Frames of reference, habits of mind and transformative learning, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 52, 2, pp. 178-196, (2020); Global Risks Report 2021, (2021); International Journal of Educational Research Review, (2020)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124979097"

More specifically, this study conceptually identified social media influencer attributes such as language similarity, interest similarity, interaction frequency, and self-disclosure and examined the respective effects of each dimension on perceived friendship and psychological well-being, consequently resulting in loyalty toward social media influencers. The authors collected and analyzed data from 388 social media users in the United States via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk with multivariate analyses to test the hypothesized associations among the variables in this study. The findings indicated that perceived friendship was significantly influenced by language similarity, interest similarity, and self-disclosure, but did not have a significant impact on psychological well-being. Additionally, perceived friendship significantly affected psychological well-being and loyalty, and psychological well-being significantly influenced loyalty. Lastly, social media influencers’ social responsibility moderated the path from psychological well-being to loyalty. Based on these findings, this study proposes theoretical and managerial implications for the social media influencer marketing context.","Digital Attributes; Friendship; Loyalty; Parasocial Interaction; Psychological Well-being; Social Media; Social Media Influencer; Social Responsibility; Consumption Behavior; Corporate Social Responsibility; Health Impact; Marketing; Mental Health; Social Media; Article; Consumer; Friendship; Human; Human Experiment; Language; Psychological Well-being; Self Disclosure; Social Responsibility; Theoretical Study; United States; Publication; Humans; Marketing; Publications; Social Media; Social Responsibility","consumption behavior; corporate social responsibility; health impact; marketing; mental health; social media; article; consumer; friendship; human; human experiment; language; psychological well-being; self disclosure; social responsibility; theoretical study; United States; publication; Humans; Marketing; Publications; Social Media; Social Responsibility","","Arora, Anuja, Measuring social media influencer index- insights from facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 49, pp. 86-101, (2019); Mackson, Samantha B., Instagram: Friend or foe?

Digital channels enable reaching large audiences in a short period of time, and engaging consumers in message sharing activities to reap those rewards has its own challenges. Companies need to understand what increases sharing of their sustainability messages, but they must be mindful of not overstating their sustainability efforts which may be perceived as greenwashing. The Information Adoption Model is used to assess how message information quality and source credibility affect sharing of corporate sustainability messages. A fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis is conducted on a survey of UK social media users (n = 527). Results show that dimensions of information quality and source credibility act in combination to influence sustainability message sharing.

The research study aims to find out various designated positions in job advertisements. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from a major weekly job journal “Employment News” in India over five years from 2016 to 2020. The Employment News provides the latest job vacancies of central/state governments, public sector undertakings and autonomous bodies in India. Each issue of Employment News was carefully scanned and searched for job advertisements in the field of LIS. The researcher analyzed various posts on permanent, deputation and short-term contracts to gain insights into the job’s skills. Findings: The findings highlight that public sector academic and school libraries are the top employers of LIS professionals. One of the most frequent demands of employers is profession-related work experience. Results show that employers place the strongest emphasis on library administration, computer knowledge, technical skills, managerial skills and soft skills. Library management, library supervision and procurement of journals and books are the primary job responsibilities for top-level positions. Research limitations/implications: The weekly job journal, Employment News, is the largest source of LIS jobs in publicly funded organizations and institutions in India. It does not cover private educational institutes, industries and corporates. Job-related data were collected solely from this journal for the duration of 2016–2020. Therefore, this research study does not fully represent the LIS job market with regard to private educational institutes and corporate organizations. Practical implications: The research findings can help LIS professionals prepare themselves according to market needs and demands. The LIS school should integrate these required skills and competencies into the course curriculum for preparing professionals in the digital age. Originality/value: The results are benchmarked to guide and evaluate LIS course curricula in India. LIS schools may emphasize soft skills in future curriculum design, which employers frequently seek.","Employability Skills; Job Advertisement; Job Trends; Knowledge And Skills; Soft skills; Technical Skills","","Funding: This research was supported by the Research Council of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India.","Advertising Creative Strategy Copy and Design, (2025); BıNıCı, Kasım, What are the information technology skills needed in information institutions?

Information technology (IT) solutions and practices will help to enable organizations to achieve their ESG goals. As ESG concepts become more relevant to both IT-producing organizations and IT-using organizations, they should be represented in one or more learning outcomes for students in information systems (IS) academic programs. But ESG is a broad term that has multiple meanings and taxonomies. It overlaps with its predecessor term, corporate social responsibility (CSR), which many business and IS academic programs already cover. This raises questions on whether and how to include ESG concepts in the IS curriculum. For instance, should ESG be a theme running through one or more existing IS courses? Should there be an entire course devoted to ESG (or a subset of ESG)? How should coverage of ESG replace or augment existing coverage of subjects such as e-waste, digital ethics, and societal impacts of computing? This session will share ideas from ongoing research into the intersections and linkages of ESG and IS academic programs. Topics will include the current state, key trends, and options for IS programs looking to update and strengthen their coverage of ESG concepts.","Curricula; Economic And Social Effects; Electronic Waste; Information Use; Social Aspects; 'current; Academic Program; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Ethics; E-wastes; Information System Projects; Information Technology Solutions; Key Trends; Learning Outcome; Societal Impacts; Information Systems","Curricula; Economic and social effects; Electronic Waste; Information use; Social aspects; 'current; Academic program; Corporate social responsibility; Digital ethics; E-wastes; Information system projects; Information technology solutions; Key trends; Learning outcome; Societal impacts; Information systems","","","","Association for Information Systems","","9781958200001","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192520983"

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a key event changing our lives while businesses have to change their daily operations and working from home has become the norm. So, it is possible to say that business activities and business models have undergone some form of digital transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Greece, the Food Industry can be characterized as one of the most dynamic and competitive economic sectors which is distinguished for its growth prospects. The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to investigate the impact of green entrepreneurship and digital transformation into the performance of Greek SMEs in the food sector and (ii) to highlight the new trends integrated in new business models in the sector. To meet the research purpose, a bibliometric and co-citation analysis was used based on the R package and graphene as a subject of research for bibliometric analysis. The knowledge gained in this article shows how the digital transformation changed the functioning of the companies in the food industry.

Recently, companies have started initiatives to provide digitally co-created CSR, in which consumers can decide to which project, organization or foundation a company donates. Despite early research efforts, still, less is known about the effectiveness of such approaches in terms of customer loyalty and whether consumer characteristics impact the effectiveness. To this end, we conducted a scenario-based experiment with 241 participants, in which we manipulated different types of CSR activities, including a digitally co-created mode of corporate social responsibility that involves a “you decide, we donate approach”. We confirm the effectiveness of digitally co-created CSR and show that consumer innovativeness as a consumer characteristic has no moderating effect.

Different from corporations and large institutions, these businesses and organizations — what we collectively term the “salad group” within our sample — associated their product or service (ranging from salads to yoga mats to chocolate) with the project of creating a more local, socially just, and inclusive community. A thematic analysis of 81 crowdsourced organization e-mail messages identified the use of both internal and external appeals for action, although organizations chiefly focused on their internal actions. Our analysis revealed that these e-mails primarily offered solutions that invited or highlighted Black participation in their business enterprises. We describe such statements as salad solidarity, a genre of promotion that simultaneously appeals to consumers and social change. Indeed, the framing of possible external responses as tied to consumer choice — and internal responses as tied to a company’s growth and reach — do not directly address the structural problems that spurred these e-mail campaigns. Consequently, such corporate and digital messaging of social movements provokes questions about the commercialization of political movements and the value that language and digital tools hold in building solidarity. We conclude with observations on how e-mails, and digital platforms more broadly, can and cannot facilitate political change, from the analytical lens of racial capitalism. These findings have broader implications for the study of corporate-social responsibility, networked social movements, and mediated communication.","","","The authors would like to thank Joshua Osvaldo Arralyes for providing essential research assistance in collecting and arranging the original e-mail collection in the summer of 2020.","On Being Included Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life, (2012); Banet-Weiser, Sarah, Authentic™: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, pp. 1-265, (2012); Enigma of Diversity the Language of Race and the Limits of Racial Justice, (2015); Bojé, David Michael, The sexual politics of sneakers: ""Common ground"" and absent-referent stories in the Nike debate, Organization and Environment, 14, 3, pp. 356-363, (2001); Racism Without Racists Color Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States, (2003); Boyd, D.

Establishing a positive correlation of technology with other factors of a certain destination is necessary for the development of a smart tourism destination. The smart tourism destination is based on the digitalization of the destination's tourist system, personalization of experiences and services, and the use of corporate social responsibility. Digitalization means the application of modern ICT when interacting with tourists. Personalization of the experiences and services implies an expanded tourism supply that includes special programs and tourist animation/entertainment. The corporate social responsibility (CSR) of the destination represents business operations that are run in line with the principles of sustainability, green economy and ethics. Starting from this, the purpose of this research is to detect and explore the potential of Koprivnica as the flagship tourist destination of the Podravina Region. This research aims to provide a model for the development of the Koprivnica smart tourism destination, which is based on the conducted qualitative research. To present the smart tourism destination model, the method of analysis and the method of comparison with destination Split were used, which is the leader in the process of transforming the classic tourist destination into a smart one. Considering the position of Koprivnica in relation to the emissive tourism markets/centres, the rich cultural and historical heritage of the destination and the preserved environment, Koprivnica has the competitive advantage of being the bearer of the Podravina region’s development of smart tourism as part of the Koprivnica-Križevci County. Koprivnica is the headquarters of the Koprivnica-Križevci County’s Tourist Board, thus it is the administrative centre of the Podravina Region’s tourist system and it certainly has the potential for faster implementati-on of the smart destination model. In tourism terms, Koprivnica has not yet reached its full tourist potential. Branding Koprivnica as a smart tourism destination will enable its faster positioning in the tourist market. The resource base of Koprivnica, the current infrastructure and the tourism carrying capacity (TCC) distinguishes Koprivnica from other destinations. Based on the research results presented in this paper, the main guidelines for the development of the smart tourism destination model of Koprivnica are presented.","Digital Transformation; Expectations And Satisfaction; Experience; Koprivnica; Smart Destination; Smart Tourism; Comparative Study; Corporate Social Responsibility; Tourism Development; Tourism Market; Tourist Destination; Croatia; Koprivnica; Podravina","comparative study; corporate social responsibility; tourism development; tourism market; tourist destination; Croatia; Koprivnica; Podravina","","Boes, Kim, Smart tourism destinations: ecosystems for tourism destination competitiveness, International Journal of Tourism Cities, 2, 2, pp. 108-124, (2016); Artificial Intelligence to Design Collaborative Strategy an Application to Urban Destinations, (2021); Primjeri Dobre Prakse Kao Temelj Za Razvoj Grada Splita Kao Pametnog Grada, (2019); Comprehension of Innovative Solutions in Hospitality Industry, (2016); Fuchs, Matthias, Applying business intelligence for knowledge generation in tourism destinations - a case study from Sweden, pp. 161-174, (2015); Grad Koprivnica Sluzbena Internet Stranica; From Smart Destinations to Smart Tourism Regions, (2018); Gretzel, Ulrike, Smart tourism: foundations and developments, Electronic Markets, 25, 3, pp. 179-188, (2015); Bright and Dark Sides of Artificial Intelligence A Futures Perspective on Tourist Destination Experiences, (2021); Gathering and Deploying Tourism Destination Intelligence, (2012)","","Hrvatski Zemljopis","13335286","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160267149"

While being a vital tool for preventing safety and economic mishaps in oil and gas wells, it is also one of the primary responsibilities of the Production Engineer. Three examples of technological advancements in the area of real-time data monitoring and intelligent-field visualization systems, which have largely enhanced the capabilities of the Production Engineer to monitor Well Integrity parameters across large fields are presented. The real-time data monitoring and intelligent-field visualization system functions based on a feedback loop system, which continuously monitors well integrity parameters such as pressure, temperature, voltage and current. The output from the probes installed in the well are passed to a Central Processing Unit where the electrical signal is processed, converted to well integrity parameters and compared with set points. Deviation are recorded and anomalies are flagged off for prompt intervention. Continuous real-time monitoring of Annuli Pressure, Well Head Pressure and Voltage/Current led to timely identification of Well Head Casing Leak, Failed Well Head Valve and corroded casing respectively in the three cases studied. The most significant new finding is that anomalies in other cases typically take up to one year to identify due to less frequent integrity survey practice adopted in fields where the intelligent-field technology is non-existent. This is important because timely intervention made possible by real-time monitoring systems safeguards corporation assets, reputation and the environment. The implemented Intelligent Field Remote Surveillance and Monitoring System has shown its significance in optimizing well integrity solutions in large fields, protecting people, enabling prompt intervention and saving the environment. To achieve this target, collaboration within several departments and organizations is required within an oil company. As such, the concept can only be successful if it is part of the corporate vision and is driven at a high level in any company. Intelligent Field is a concept which helps in enhancing the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons from a reservoir in the most optimized manner. This end objective is achieved by installing sensors and control devices in the fields that can be remotely monitored and controlled. The data from such devices is evaluated on a real-time basis to understand the reservoir behavior and taking remedial measures to drain the reservoir in the most optimum manner. Any I-Field network consists of the listed components starting from the field up to the engineer desktop: Equipment such as: PDHMS, MPFM, SWC, Single Phase flow Meters, Wellhead transmitters, SSSV and others and connected with remote terminal unit (RTU) gathering the data from well's equipment and transferring the data through communication conduits such as fiber optic cables, V-SAT, ethernet, radio, microwave, other wireless technique to supervisory control and data acquisition system is placed to gathers data from RTUs via instrument tags which local assembly point to gather the data. assembly point to gather the data from supervisory control via tags area is virtual server which gathers data from multiple local servers via local tags to be available in engineer desktop. (Image Presented) Digital Oil Fields do not only produce oil but also produce data. Crude oil is referred to as a raw material for the chemical industry and field data are also referred as raw data. Both are more likely go through various stages prior to distributing them to end-users/customers; they have to be extracted, transferred, processed and refined. Nowadays, data is being referred to as the new oil for the potential value it can generate. Data management becomes of greater importance with the emergence of IR 4.0 capabilities including various sensors and measurement devices along with applications such as big data analytics and machine learning. For production optimization: it would be very beneficial to have an estimated flow rates based on given data, currently rate data is only available intermittently via multi-phase flowmeter or portable testing. To have real-time 24/7 flow rate would be highly advantageous for surveillance and production optimization. Driving I-field toward digitalization to let machine learning understand the algorithms and calculate the rate based on various data. The below chart showed machine learning technique based on current behavior to the predict the future and take the right action accordingly.","Data Visualization; Flowmeters; Gasoline; Oil Wells; Program Processors; Real Time Systems; Visualization; Field Visualization; Intelligent Fields; Larger Fields; Machine-learning; Real- Time; Real-time Data Monitoring; Remote Monitoring System; Remote Surveillance System; Sensor Device; Visualization System; Engineers","Data visualization; Flowmeters; Gasoline; Oil wells; Program processors; Real time systems; Visualization; Field visualization; Intelligent fields; Larger fields; Machine-learning; Real- time; Real-time data monitoring; Remote monitoring system; Remote Surveillance System; Sensor device; Visualization system; Engineers","","Afaleg, N.

ESG and digital transformation reinforce each other as they aim to improve efficiency and meet stakeholders inside and outside the company. This is true for telecommunication companies, where disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data or cloud computing are reshaping the industry. Assessment of the impact of sustainability disclosures on companies’ value is a task of high interest for academics and practitioners from telecommunication companies. ESG disclosure serves as a key channel to inform investors about the efficiency of ESG risk management and control practices of the firm and thus can impact the firm’s financial performance and market value. However, there are numerous controversies in the academic literature on this topic and a lack of research specifically for the telecommunication industry. We closed the research gaps and investigated the impact of ESG disclosure on Tobin-Q of 93 US-listed telecommunication service companies between 2011-2021. We found that aggregated ESG disclosure score positively impacted telecoms’ Tobin-Q. Among individual ESG disclosure pillars, only corporate governance positively influenced Tobin-Q, while the impact of environmental and social pillars was statistically insignificant. We also found that CEO duality significantly and negatively impacted Tobin-Q. The presence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee, greater gender diversity and a higher percentage of independent directors on the board positively affected the value of the telecoms. The result of the study can be applied in developing ESG rating methodologies for telecommunication companies. They can also assist telecom companies’ managers and stakeholders to identify key value drivers of the ESG agenda.","Corporate Governance; Esg Disclosure; Ict; Sustainable Development; Tobin Q","","Funding text 1: The research was partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the strategic academic leadership program ‘Priority ????’ (agreement 075-15-2021-1333, dated 30 September 2021).; Funding text 2: The research was partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the strategic academic leadership program ‘Priority 2030’ (agreement 075-15-2021-1333, dated 30 September 2021).","Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Atan, Ruhaya, The impacts of environmental, social, and governance factors on firm performance: Panel study of Malaysian companies, Management of Environmental Quality, 29, 2, pp. 182-194, (2018); Berawi, Mohammed Ali, Managing Nature 5.0: The Role of Digital Technologies in the Circular Economy, International Journal of Technology, 11, 4, (2020); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, Sustainability disclosure and its impact on telecommunication and information technology sectors' performance: worldwide evidence, International Journal of Emergency Services, (2022); Cai, Li, Corporate Environmental Responsibility and Equity Prices, Journal of Business Ethics, 125, 4, pp. 617-635, (2014); Cho, Charles H., The role of environmental disclosures as tools of legitimacy: A research note, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 32, 7-8, pp. 639-647, (2007); undefined, (2021); Dhaliwal, Dan S., Corporate social responsibility disclosure and the cost of equity capital: The roles of stakeholder orientation and financial transparency, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 33, 4, pp. 328-355, (2014); Corporate Social Responsibility and the Cost of Corporate Bonds, (2015); Journal of Accounting and Public Policy","","Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia","20869614; 20872100","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145889780"

Today, with the rapid development of science and technology, digital technology has a profound effect on the whole society and enterprises. Then, one question is proposed: how should enterprises make strategic decisions to deal with the current opportunities and challenges, enhance their own corporate risk-taking, and then achieve high-quality development? We collected the data from companies listed on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2020. Starting from the corporate risk-taking perspective, we conducted an empirical analysis to validate the relationship between digital transformation of corporations and corporate risk-taking. We found that digital transformation of corporations enhanced corporate risk-taking. The enhanced effect was realized as digital transformation improved the information disclosure quality and asset utilization. The enhanced effect was even greater if the enterprise occupied a less favorable competitive position or received less media attention. This paper reviews the literature concerning economic consequences of enterprise digital transformation, shed new light on the enterprise's selection of digital strategies to achieve sustainable development, and guides the digital transformation of an enterprise.

Consequently, legislation exists to encourage organisations to procure computers with a low total carbon footprint. The rationale being that both scope 2 use-phase and scope 3 supply chain emissions can be reduced in the long term to contribute to wider reaching abatement targets. However, research finds that current computer product carbon footprint information is both insufficiently available and inconsistent to enable such a strategy. Further research determines barriers including associated incremental cost and perceived impact also prevent the diffusion of sustainable computing strategies. As such, the case study objective is to examine the impact of overcoming such limitations and barriers within an organisation subject to both the new legislation and a holistic climate emergency. By doing so the research question, 'Can meaningful representation of end user computing carbon footprint data drive human behavioural changes to abate greenhouse gas emissions?' is answered. Conducted over 3-years using newly developed methodologies, end user computer related emissions are quantified within a Greater London Council. Presented in a format reflecting the triple bottom line of corporate and social responsibility accounting, values for planet, people and profit are defined using standard emissions units, environmental equivalents, a per capita ratio and monetary savings. Subsequent behavioural changes driven by access to the new information are fourfold. Firstly, adoption of low energy devices reduces annual scope 2 emissions by 15, 841 kgCO2e. Secondly, extended device retention periods displaces 515, 190 kgCO2e of supply chain emissions. Thirdly, a new technology enabled remote working scheme is justified and adopted, avoiding 4, 516, 584 kgCO2e of commuting emissions. Finally, new computer procurement assessment practices are adopted to ensure ongoing abatement is maximised and compliance with legislation exceeded. Consequently, the council responds to the climate emergency strategy via the newly proven sustainable end user computing strategy by reducing energy consumption, waste and contributing to sustainable transport. In total, related emissions are reduced by 39% per year whilst saving £228, 418 annually. As such, it is proven that the barriers of cost and perceived impact are surmountable and significant emissions abatement achievable when presented with meaningful information that drives behavioural change.","Computer Carbon Footprint; Computer Energy Efficiency; Computer Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Human-computer Interaction; Behavioral Research; Digital Storage; Energy Efficiency; Energy Utilization; Gas Emissions; Green Computing; Greenhouse Gases; Human Computer Interaction; Personal Computers; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Behavioral Changes; Computer Carbon Footprint; Computer Energy Efficiency; Computer Greenhouse Gas Emission; Computing Strategies; End User Computing; Greenhouse Gas Abatements; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Supply Chain Emissions; Suttons; Carbon Footprint","Behavioral research; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Green computing; Greenhouse gases; Human computer interaction; Personal computers; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Behavioral changes; Computer carbon footprint; Computer energy efficiency; Computer greenhouse gas emission; Computing strategies; End user computing; Greenhouse gas abatements; Greenhouse gas emissions; Supply chain emissions; Suttons; Carbon footprint","Rob Procter, Professor of Social Informatics at the University of Warwick for ongoing co-supervision.

For, self-government in this context is superior because, first, it is free from the above innate deficiencies, and second, it is endowed with several advantages. In particular, it matches policy choices to citizen preferences. It offers institutional flexibility and efficiency.

Instead, consumers expect companies to behave ethically responsible and voluntarily assume more responsibilities in the digital context, particularly related to data privacy and security. Broader approaches, like the emerging concept of Corporate Digital Responsibility, make it possible to see responsibility with regard to data privacy and security in the broader context of a company's digital responsibilities and thus to develop a more holistic understanding. However, responsible behavior alone is not enough; rather an adequate communication is the evaluation basis of consumers. Accordingly, this work-in-progress evaluates current corporate communication regarding data privacy and security from an ethical view, thus illustrating best practices and paving future paths for corporate communication.","Best Practices; Communication Guidelines; Company Communication; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Data Privacy; Data Security; Consumer Behavior; Philosophical Aspects; Best Practices; Communication Guideline; Company Communication; Corporate Communications; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporates; Data Privacy And Securities; Digital Technologies; Security Communication; Status Quo; Data Privacy","Consumer behavior; Philosophical aspects; Best practices; Communication guideline; Company communication; Corporate communications; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporates; Data privacy and securities; Digital technologies; Security communication; Status quo; Data privacy","The Hessian State Chancellery - Hessian Minister of Digital Strategy and Development supported this work under the promotional reference 6/493/71574093 (CDR-CAT).","Anderson, Chad, Information Security Control Theory: Achieving a Sustainable Reconciliation Between Sharing and Protecting the Privacy of Information, Journal of Management Information Systems, 34, 4, pp. 1082-1112, (2017); Baumann, Annika, The Price of Privacy: An Evaluation of the Economic Value of Collecting Clickstream Data, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 61, 4, pp. 413-431, (2019); Barmer; Bélanger, France, Privacy in the digital age: A review of information privacy research in information systems, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 35, 4, pp. 1017-1041, (2011); undefined; Continental Ag; Proceedings of the Open Identity Summit 2022 Oid2022, (2022); Deutsche Telekom Ag; Ewe Ag; Greenaway, Kathleen E., Company information privacy orientation: A conceptual framework, Information Systems Journal, 25, 6, pp. 579-606, (2015)","Demmler, D.; Krupka, D.; Federrath, H.","Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)","29447682; 16175468","9783885797432; 9783885792956; 3885793458; 9783885797098; 9783885792543; 3885793644; 9783885792222; 9783885796053; 9783885792574; 9783885796985","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139757603"

The possibilities of integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) tools and economic digitalization processes have been investigated and a new format for evaluating the activities of small and medium-sized businesses related to their level of maturity has been defined. This study formulates patterns of CSR development, proposes the use of a new concept of “digital space of social sustainable development” (DSSSD), and reports a methodological toolkit devised for determining the level of maturity of the digital space of social sustainable development (DSSSD) of food industry enterprises. The developed methodological support makes it possible to assess CSR by economic, social, and informatization criteria. The proposed CSR scorecard makes it possible to compare companies and rank them in the coordinate system of corporate social responsibility/ digitalization. 17 key indicators have been identified, which are formed into three key groups. Confirmation of the effectiveness of the methodology is the execution of calculations for small and medium-sized businesses in the food industry. According to the results of the calculations, the maturity levels of eight enterprises of the food industry in Ukraine in the DSSSD space were determined. The analysis made it possible to determine that four enterprises are at the initial level of DSSSD (zone 1 Digital Descriptive), two enterprises are moving to zone 2 (Solutions Analytics Digital), and two enterprises are in a state of transition to zone 3 (Smart CIS) due to increasing the level of digitalization and the formation of an internal CSR system, which indicates their active development. This makes it possible to assert that the technique is effective and can be useful for enterprises around the world. The selected indicators are used at all enterprises of those countries that use the international accounting and reporting system. Improving the system in the areas of formation of corporate social responsibility and the introduction of digitalization of the enterprise makes it possible to optimize the information systems of enterprises, automate management procedures, and create new communication channels with consumers and beneficiaries. This will contribute to the development of a systemic socio-economic effect of business, care for the needs of people, the development of the social climate at an enterprise, and the emergence of new formats of interaction between business, the state, and society","Area Of Maturity Of The Enterprise; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Space Of Sustainable Development; Digitalization; Digitalization Of Business","","","European Journal of Management Issues, (2015); Efektyvna Ekonomika, (2020); Zioło, Magdalena, IN SEARCH OF A FINANCIAL MODEL FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 28, 4, pp. 920-947, (2022); Ekonomika Transportnoho Kompleksu, (2017); Camilleri, Mark A., Corporate citizenship and social responsibility policies in the United States of America, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 8, 1, pp. 77-93, (2017); Jamali, Dima R., Corporate Social Responsibility in Developing Countries as an Emerging Field of Study, International Journal of Management Reviews, 20, 1, pp. 32-61, (2018); Martyniuk, Olena A., Formation of an innovative concept of management on the basis of reconstruction of genetic algorithm of management technology, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 7, 2, pp. 487-499, (2019); Kim, Yong-chan, A New Digital Value Chain Model with PLC in Biopharmaceutical Industry: The Implication for Open Innovation, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 2, (2022); Framework for Enterprise Architecture Background Description and Utility by John A Zachman; IBM Systems Journal, (1987)","","Technology Center","17294061; 17293774","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137637625"

As such, the purpose of this contribution is to evaluate the applicability of the existing CSR standard to CDR to pave the way for CDR standardization in the future.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digitalization; Ethical Guidelines; Standardization; Clock And Data Recovery Circuits (cdr Circuits); Data Privacy; Iso Standards; Standardization; 'current; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporates; Digital Products; Digital Services; Digital Technologies; Digitalization; Ethical Guideline; Managers","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Data privacy; ISO Standards; Standardization; 'current; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporate responsibility; Corporate social responsibility; Corporates; Digital products; Digital services; Digital technologies; Digitalization; Ethical guideline; Managers","This work has been supported by the Hessian State Chancellery – Hessian Minister of Digital Strategy and Development under the promotional reference 6/493/71574093 (CDR-CAT).","APA Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, (2011); Baumann, Annika, The Price of Privacy: An Evaluation of the Economic Value of Collecting Clickstream Data, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 61, 4, pp. 413-431, (2019); Bélanger, France, Privacy in the digital age: A review of information privacy research in information systems, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 35, 4, pp. 1017-1041, (2011); Clifford, Damian, Online dispute resolution: Settling data protection disputes in a digital world of customers, Computer Law and Security Review, 32, 2, pp. 272-285, (2016); Díaz Andrade, Antonio, Digital enforcement: Rethinking the pursuit of a digitally-enabled society, Information Systems Journal, 31, 1, pp. 184-197, (2021); Frederick, William C., Corporate social responsibility: From founders to millennials, pp. 3-38, (2018); Granados, Nelson F., Information transparency in business-to-consumer markets: Concepts, framework, and research Agenda, Information Systems Research, 21, 2, pp. 207-226, (2010); Sustainability Management Forum, (2021); Hinz, Oliver, Price discrimination in E-commerce?

The results of economic and mathematical modeling of the impact of the service quality management bank financing based on corporate social responsibility in the digital economy on sustainable development results, using the method of regression analysis, showed that standard corporate social responsibility in the digital economy does not have a positive effect on sustainable development. The novelty of the article lies in the development of a digital approach to the service quality managing of bank financing based on corporate social responsibility for sustainable development. All three areas of the service quality management of bank financing in a new approach - the manifestation of CSR, FinTech development and SDG support - are systemically interconnected and support each other. This ensures a constant improvement in the service quality of bank financing. Improving the security of banking (it is recommended to increase it by 97.28%) and development of Internet banking (it is recommended to increase it by 96.81%) are proposed as measures for the practical implementation of the new approach. Due to the practical implementation of the proposed author’s recommendations, the level of sustainable development will become the maximum (reach 1st place), that is, increase by 96.64%.

We analyze 32 years of digital newspaper articles on Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) to explore sustainability trends based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework leveraging different content analysis techniques (e.g. topic modeling, sentiment analysis). Our results support the increased awareness and importance of sustainability in the luxury fashion sector over time, provide theoretical implications for applying the TBL framework to the longitudinal dataset, and offer insights to business practitioners on expanding their sustainability efforts in the luxury fashion industry.

Case overview/synopsis: Digi Telecommunications (Digi) has been publishing annual sustainability reporting in line with Global Reporting Initiatives since 2009. Albern Murty, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Digi, the largest player in the mobile telecommunications industry in Malaysia by the number of subscribers, decided to establish a responsible business brand known as Yellow Heart in 2018 to better serve their stakeholders demand. There was a low stakeholder understanding of Digi’s sustainability efforts and societal impacts. Digi’s Sustainability department aspired to make Yellow Heart the best industry practice for continuous improvements by making Responsible Business commitment one of the main pillars of the company’s strategy and vision. Yellow Heart was linked to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)10 on reducing inequalities by focusing on Digital Inclusion and Resilience to increase safe access opportunities, provide marginalized communities with opportunities to pursue interests in digital learning pathways and create a more sustainable digital future for all. The case study illustrates the sustainability management at Digi and the planned migration from sustainability reporting to integrated reporting to build trust in the business with all the stakeholders. The case dilemma involves the challenges that Philip Ling Oon Hun, the Head of the Sustainability, faced in deciding the SDGs to focus on and measuring and reporting their outcomes to contribute to the greater good, not only in pure business terms but also to society at large.

However, much of the existing literature studies commercial platforms that seek to maximize profit. In contrast, we focus on a platform for volunteers that aims to maximize social impact. This business model is called a platform for the common good. The article proposes a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) model that explains how a platform for the common good creates value. Our model maps the key strategic feedback loops that constitute the core structure of the platform and explains its growth and performance through time. We show that multiple types of network effects create interlocking, reinforcing feedback loops. Overall, the article contributes towards a dynamic theory of the platforms for the common good. Moreover, the article provides insights for social entrepreneurs who seek to build, understand, and optimize platforms that maximize social value and managers of companies that seek to participate in such platforms. Social entrepreneurs should seek to leverage the critical feedback loops of their platform.","Active Citizenship; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Transformation; Environmental Social And Governance (esg); Feedback Loop; Network Effect; Platform; Social Impact; Social Innovation; Systems Research; Business; Economic Growth; Entrepreneur; Innovation; Strategic Approach","business; economic growth; entrepreneur; innovation; strategic approach","","Platform Revolution, (2016); Parker, Geoffrey G., Innovation, openness, and platform control, Management Science, 64, 7, pp. 3015-3032, (2018); Ssrn Electron J, (2021); Cusumano, Michael A., The future of platforms, MIT Sloan Management Review, 61, 3, pp. 46-54, (2020); 20 Leading Social Impact Platforms Making A Difference with Digital Potential; Rawhouser, Hans, Social Impact Measurement: Current Approaches and Future Directions for Social Entrepreneurship Research, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 43, 1, pp. 82-115, (2019); Business Dynamics Systems Thinking and Modeling for A Complex World, (2000); Economides, Nicholas S., Two-sided competition of proprietary vs. open source technology platforms and the implications for the software industry, Management Science, 52, 7, pp. 1057-1071, (2006); Constantinides, Panos, Platforms and infrastructures in the digital age, Information Systems Research, 29, 2, pp. 381-400, (2018); Tan, Burcu, Platform pricing and investment to drive third-party value creation in two-sided networks, Information Systems Research, 31, 1, pp. 217-239, (2020)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122250701"

In the light of the existing “narrow” treatment, venture investors seek private commercial interests in financial support for Industry 4.0, ignoring other interests that fall beyond the limits of the current “narrow” treatment of venture capital. A “wide” treatment of venture capital 4.0 proposed in this paper allows for improving venture investors' market strategies. Implementing this treatment, they will strive for providing a whole range of advantages for society. Due to this novel approach, venture capital 4.0 might become a tool of corporate social responsibility. To substantiate this novel approach, this paper considers data for 2020 that reflect the influence of venture capital 4.0 on the economy in the period of its stability for 33 countries of the OECD, including developed and developing countries. Econometric modelling based on the official statistics data proves that Industry 4.0 venture capital will help achieve such growth goals as innovative development, global competitiveness, and increasing digital competitiveness. The limitations of this research are due to the impossibility of achieving such goals as sustainable development, economic growth, and implementation of human potential; what's more, the specifics of developing countries have not been studied sufficiently. The conclusions are oriented mainly at developed countries and could merely partially be applied to developing countries. During further research, it is expedient to explore – more thoroughly – the experience of the influence of Industry 4.0 venture capital on emerging economies.","Competitiveness; Digital Technologies; Industry 4.0; Venture Capital","","The authors received no funding from an external source.","Abiri, Arash, Simulating Developmental Cardiac Morphology in Virtual Reality Using a Deformable Image Registration Approach, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 46, 12, pp. 2177-2188, (2018); Aggarwal, Divya, Sustainable finance in emerging markets: A venture capital investment decision Dilemma, South Asian Journal of Business and Management Cases, 7, 2, pp. 131-143, (2018); Aldieri, Luigi, Green economy and sustainable development: The economic impact of innovation on employment, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 10, (2018); Amona, Daniel, Exit performance of venture capital backed high-tech start-ups, (2018); Amri, Fethi, ICT, total factor productivity, and carbon dioxide emissions in Tunisia, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 146, pp. 212-217, (2019); Anggusti, Martono, Sustainable development in the wake of the 4th industrial revolution in Indonesia, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 420, 1, (2018); Ansari, Manouchehr, Identifying the applications of internet of things in the smart home by using meta synthesis method, Journal of Information Technology Management, 9, 4, pp. 659-678, (2018); Ayinde, Lateef Adeshina, Rethinking the roles and skills of information professionals in the 4th Industrial Revolution, Business Information Review, 37, 4, pp. 142-153, (2020); Bijlsma, Michiel J., The effect of financial development on economic growth: a meta-analysis, Applied Economics, 50, 57, pp. 6128-6148, (2018); Bock, Carolin, Growth factors of research-based spin-offs and the role of venture capital investing, Journal of Technology Transfer, 43, 5, pp. 1375-1409, (2018)","","Elsevier Ltd","24058440","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122197810"

Stakeholders now prefer those businesses which are inclined towards social norms and virtues. In the era of digitalization, digital social responsibility (DSR) has become the strategic decision for all kinds of business organizations. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to highlight the achievement of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and strategic performance (SP) through customer engagement with digital social responsibility (DSR). Customer engagement with DSR is also tested as a mediator between DSR and CSR performance, and DSR and SP. Data were collected from the owners/managers of hi-tech Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For the purpose of data analysis, various statistical procedures were applied. Results proved that DSR plays an essential role in explaining customer engagement with DSR, SP and CSR performance. Customer engagement with DSR directly affects SP and CSR performance, and also acts as a mediator. This study contributes to both theory and practical management by investigating how DSR helps to achieve SP and CSR performance. This is a unique study of the mechanism to achieve SP and CSR performance through DSR and customer engagement with DSR.","Corporate Social Responsibility Performance; Customer Engagement With Dsr; Digital Social Responsibility (dsr); Strategic Performance; Business Development; Consumption Behavior; Corporate Social Responsibility; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Strategic Approach","business development; consumption behavior; corporate social responsibility; small and medium-sized enterprise; strategic approach","Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.","Schultz, Mario D., Conceptualizing data-deliberation: The starry sky beetle, environmental system risk, and Habermasian CSR in the digital age, Business Ethics, 29, 2, pp. 303-313, (2020); Okazaki, Shintaro, Exploring digital corporate social responsibility communications on Twitter, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 675-682, (2020); Feroz, Abdul Karim, Digital transformation and environmental sustainability: A review and research agenda, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 3, pp. 1-20, (2021); Bouwman, Harry, Digitalization, business models, and SMEs: How do business model innovation practices improve performance of digitalizing SMEs?, Telecommunications Policy, 43, 9, (2019); Bossetta, Michael, The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election, Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 95, 2, pp. 471-496, (2018); Isensee, Carmen, The relationship between organizational culture, sustainability, and digitalization in SMEs: A systematic review, Journal of Cleaner Production, 275, (2020); Benitez, Jose, How corporate social responsibility activities influence employer reputation: The role of social media capability, Decision Support Systems, 129, (2020); Business and Society Review, (2005); Chumaceiro Hernández, Ana Cecilia, University social responsibility in the organizational happiness management, Utopia y Praxis Latinoamericana, 25, Extra 2, pp. 427-440, (2020); Hur, Won-moo, Does customer engagement in corporate social responsibility initiatives lead to customer citizenship behaviour?

It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

Largely missing in these discourses, however, are the potential costs of datafication for pupils’ and teachers’ agency and the meaning of education itself. This article explores the general discursive framing by which these surveillant practices in education have come to seem natural. Through a study of commercial suppliers of educational platforms, we show how the prevailing vision of datafication in their discourses categorises software systems, not teachers, as central to education, reimagining space, time, and agency within educational processes around the organisation of data systems and the demands of commercial data production. Not only does this legitimate the new connective environment of dataveillance (that is, surveillance through data processing), but it also naturalises a wider normative environment in which teachers and students are assigned new roles and responsibilities. In the process, the panoptic possibilities of ubiquitous commercial access to personal educational data are presented as part of a virtuous circle of knowledge production and even training for good citizenship. This broader rethinking of education through surveillance must itself be critiqued.","Big Data; Data Collection; Datafication; Dataveillance; Surveillance","","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Enhancing Life programme ( http://enhancinglife.uchicago.edu/ ), funded by the John Templeton Foundation and administered by the University of Chicago, which funded this research under the project title ‘The Price of Connection'.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by John Templeton Foundation; University of Chicago.

Information assets have been increasingly recognized as critical business assets, turning information security into an essential tool for the resilience of organizations, driving them to align their information security strategy with the business strategy. This paper aims to study the main areas where information security should act, the roles and responsibilities of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and to understand how information security culture and awareness impacts on the CISO’s corporate responsibilities. Interviews were carried out with experienced information security consultants and information systems and information security directors, which led to the conclusion that organizations in Portugal still need to increase their maturity when it comes to information security, and that this may be due to the absence of an established security culture in the country. On the other hand, it has been recognized that the CISO’s role has been increasing in relevance, being considered that it should have a close and independent relationship with organizations’ boards.","Board Of Directors; Chief Information Security Officer (ciso); Information Security Awareness; Information Security Culture; Information Security Management","","","Allianz Risk Barometer Top Business Risks, (2016); Why do You Need A Ciso, (2017); Can A Ciso Act as A Dpo, (2017); Cyber Insurance Recent Advances Good Practices and Challenges, (2016); Lisboa Edicoes, (1977); Information Security Handbook A Guide for Managers, (2006); Is New Regulation A Threat or an Opportunity for Security Strategy, (2017); Using Enterprise Architecture for Cobit 5 Process Assessment and Process Improvement, (2015); Harvard Business Review, (2003); Role of the Chief Information Security Officer, (2016)","","Information Institute","15510808; 15510123","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124530238"

Although it seems counterintuitive at first glance, companies can support sufficiency-oriented, cleaner consumption as part of their societal responsibility. This article investigates motives for sufficiency-promoting business communication and explores related challenges resulting from the economic growth paradigm. Furthermore, it asks which digital tools are used in this communication and for what reasons. The explorative interview study with six German sufficiency-oriented clothing companies of the apparel sector reveals the significance of corporate sustainability values and strategic motives such as reputational benefits and customer loyalty. Since the companies are only pursuing moderate growth, the concurrence of supporting sufficiency and operating in a growth-driven economy is perceived as an area of tension but does not endanger their existence. Benefits of digital marketing arise from the wider audiences, cost efficiency and effective targeting. Future research opportunities entail qualitative and quantitative research to further investigate motives and barriers with different types of companies and to improve understanding of how companies ensure their continued existence whilst promoting less consumption. With our study, we explore the role communication can play in encouraging cleaner and sufficiency-oriented consumption and thus contribute to a young but flourishing research field.","Communication; Online Marketing; Qualitative Research; Sufficiency; Sustainable Consumption","","Funding for this research was granted by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project “Digitalisation and Sustainability” and by the Senate of Berlin within the “Berliner Chancengleichheitsprogramm”.

In addition, companies are claiming to be ‘corporate citizens’ in the way they deal with their environmental, employment and social/ethical responsibilities. Given the fact that large corporations are now heavily internationalized in their operational characteristics – with branches, subsidiaries, affiliates and extended supply chains operating in multiple jurisdictions – can such organizations be brought into a democratic register? Citizenship and democracy are conventionally associated with a territorial state, national sovereignty and jurisdictional independence. So, how can internationalized companies be subject to democratic forms of governance? An added problem arises with platform companies and blockchain organized digital currency providers whose operations transcend national borders from the start. This contribution discusses the issues of and provides a way for considering corporate democracy afresh in these rapidly evolving contexts.","Blockchain Governance; Global Corporate Citizenship; Mnc; Non-representational Democracy; Platform Organizations","","","Firm as A Nexus of Treaties, (1990); Beaumier, Guillaume, Global Regulations for a Digital Economy: Between New and Old Challenges, Global Policy, 11, 4, pp. 515-522, (2020); Bitcoin and Beyond Cryptocurrencies Blockchains and Global Governance, (2018); Cohney, Shaanan N., Coin-operated capitalism, Columbia Law Review, 119, 3, pp. 591-676, (2019); Driver, Ciaran, Corporate governance and democracy: The stakeholder debate revisited, Journal of Management and Governance, 6, 2, pp. 111-130, (2002); Driver, Ciaran, Corporate governance in contention, pp. 1-318, (2018); Can Institutions have Responsibilities Collective Moral Agency and International Relations, (2003); Order of Things an Archaeology of the Human Sciences, (1970); Gereffi, Gary Allan, Global Value Chains and Development: Redefining the Contours of 21st Century Capitalism, pp. 1-474, (2018); Varieties of Capitalism the Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, (2001)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","07255136","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120401492"

We analyze how strategic responses to anti-corruption can improve firm reputation and innovativeness in a rapidly digitalized world. Using a survey sample of 216 subsidiaries operating in China, we investigate our hypotheses and find supportive evidence that foreign subsidiaries are likely to engage in anti-corruption practices (ACPs) when they face strong institutional pressure. We also provide evidence that engagement in such ACPs is positively associated with enhanced firm reputation and innovativeness. The contribution of this non-market mechanism to innovativeness is strong when the digitization capability of the subsidiaries is high.","Anti-corruption Practice; Digitization Capability; Institutional Pressure; Institutional Theory; Liability Of Foreignness; Non-market Mechanism","","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Funds.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by Sookmyung Women's University Research Grants.","Adomako, Samuel, Perceived corruption, business process digitization, and SMEs’ degree of internationalization in sub-Saharan Africa, Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 196-207, (2021); undefined, (2020); Ang, Siah Hwee, The interactions of institutions on foreign market entry mode, Strategic Management Journal, 36, 10, pp. 1536-1553, (2015); Anokhin, Sergey Alexander, Entrepreneurship, innovation, and corruption, Journal of Business Venturing, 24, 5, pp. 465-476, (2009); Ardito, Lorenzo, The duality of digital and environmental orientations in the context of SMEs: Implications for innovation performance, Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 44-56, (2021); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Brouthers, Lance E., Isomorphic Pressures, Peripheral Product Attributes and Emerging Market Firm Export Performance, Management International Review, 53, 5, pp. 687-710, (2013); Bucheli, Marcelo, Political connections, the liability of foreignness, and legitimacy: A business historical analysis of multinationals’ strategies in Chile, Global Strategy Journal, 8, 3, pp. 399-420, (2018); Campbell, John L., Why would corporations behave in socially responsible ways?

This study aims to explore the role of strategic orientation (i.e., technology orientation, customer orientation) in promoting firms’ digital capabilities and NPD performance in the context of digital transformation. Using a resource-based view and its extended dynamic capabilities as a theoretical foundation, we provide a comprehensive framework by developing a set of hypotheses. In addition, we examine the moderating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the relationship between strategic orientation and NPD performance. Using data from a sample of 174 Chinese manufacturing firms, we perform structural equation modelling to empirically test our arguments. Our findings show that technology orientation and customer orientation play a critical role in driving firms’ digital capabilities. Moreover, we find that the two dimensions of strategic orientation tend to exert different effects on NPD performance, with technology orientation playing a more significant role than customer orientation in contributing to NPD performance. Finally, our findings strongly suggest that a firm’s CSR engagement moderates the relationship between its customer orientation and NPD performance, such that the higher the firm’s engagement in CSR, the greater the contribution of customer orientation to the firm’s NPD performance. Our findings provide new insights into non-market mechanisms such as CSR through which firms can compensate for their strategically oriented practices in the NPD process.","China; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Capabilities; New Product Development Performance; Strategic Orientation; Corporate Social Responsibility; Manufacturing; Modeling; Orientation; Product Development; China","corporate social responsibility; manufacturing; modeling; orientation; product development; China","","Gatignon, Hubert, Strategic orientation of the firm and new product performance, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 1, pp. 77-90, (1997); Hakala, Henri, Strategic Orientations in Management Literature: Three Approaches to Understanding the Interaction between Market, Technology, Entrepreneurial and Learning Orientations, International Journal of Management Reviews, 13, 2, pp. 199-217, (2011); Adams, Pamela, Strategic orientation, innovation performance and the moderating influence of marketing management, Journal of Business Research, 97, pp. 129-140, (2019); Jeong, Insik, Antecedents and consequences of the strategic orientations in new product development: The case of Chinese manufacturers, Industrial Marketing Management, 35, 3, pp. 348-358, (2006); Journal of Marketing, (1990); Amit, Raphael, Value Creation through Novel Resource Configurations in a Digitally Enabled World, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 11, 3, pp. 228-242, (2017); Kohli, Rajiv, Digital innovation: A review and synthesis, Information Systems Journal, 29, 1, pp. 200-223, (2019); Bharadwaj, Anandhi S., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Teece, David J., Business models and dynamic capabilities, Long Range Planning, 51, 1, pp. 40-49, (2018); Ehret, Michael, Unlocking value from machines: business models and the industrial internet of things, Journal of Marketing Management, 33, 1-2, pp. 111-130, (2017)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119615296"

How to seize the opportunity to achieve the production-marketing connection is increasingly becoming a top concern for green agri-food enterprises. Based on the theory of a task–technology fit, this study analyzes the fitness between livestreaming e-commerce and green agri-food. More specifically, the task characteristics cover the seasonality, locality, and eco-friendliness of green agri-food, and the technology characteristics cover the responsiveness, interactivity, and entertainment of livestreaming e-commerce. Using data of a sample of 574 green agri-food entrepreneurial firms collected through a web-based questionnaire, we preform structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis and find that the locality and eco-friendliness of green agri-food, the responsiveness, interactivity, and entertainment of livestreaming e-commerce have a positive effect on the fit of green agri-food livestreaming e-commerce. Moreover, the fit of green agri-food livestreaming has a positive effect on firm performance and the intention to adopt livestreaming e-commerce. This study also demonstrates that perceived corporate social responsibility has a moderating effect on the relationship between the fit of livestreaming of green agri-food and the intention to adopt livestreaming e-commerce. This study extends prior research on the task–technology fit into livestreaming e-commerce companies and provides insights into our understanding of successful adoption of livestreaming e-commerce.","Adoption; Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Performance; Green Agri-food Firm; Livestreaming E-commerce; Task–technology Fit Theory; Corporate Social Responsibility; Electronic Commerce; Fitness; Modeling; Sustainability; Technology","corporate social responsibility; electronic commerce; fitness; modeling; sustainability; technology","","International Strategic Management Review, (2015); Qi, Xin, An integrated framework to explain consumers’ purchase intentions toward green food in the Chinese context, Food Quality and Preference, 92, (2021); Li, Charlene, Review of online food delivery platforms and their impacts on sustainability, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 14, (2020); Bertram, Rose Francoise, A study of companies’ business responses to fashion e-commerce’s environmental impact, International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education, 11, 2, pp. 254-264, (2018); Zhao, Weiwei, Research on Social Responsibility of E-commerce Platform, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 439, 3, (2018); Oláh, Judit, Achieving sustainable e-commerce in environmental, social and economic dimensions by taking possible trade-offs, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 1, (2019); Sun, Yuan, How live streaming influences purchase intentions in social commerce: An IT affordance perspective, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 37, (2019); Sun, Yuan, A 2020 perspective on “How live streaming influences purchase intentions in social commerce: An IT affordance perspective”, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 40, (2020); Sohn, Jeongwoong, Factors that influence purchase intentions in social commerce, Technology in Society, 63, (2020); Lǎzǎroiu, George, Consumers’ Decision-Making Process on Social Commerce Platforms: Online Trust, Perceived Risk, and Purchase Intentions, Frontiers in Psychology, 11, (2020)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119212966"

To improve the efficiency of adopting this technology in the ECI and to facilitate decision-making by managers, this study combines the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology–organisation–environment framework models to study the factors affecting blockchain adoption intention in the ECI. In addition, the direct predictors of the relative advantages of blockchain technology in the ECI are explored. Through a questionnaire survey of 124 elderly care institutions in China, we collected 181 valid questionnaires and analysed them using a partial least squares regression structural equation model. The results show that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility, top management support and organisational readiness have a positive effect on blockchain adoption intention in the ECI, while the effects of complexity, government support and competitive pressure are insignificant. However, competitive pressure and government support can indirectly promote blockchain adoption intention by influencing top management support. Furthermore, technology trust and information security positively affect the relative advantages of blockchain technology and indirectly affect blockchain adoption intention, while privacy protection is insignificant.","Blockchain Adoption Intention; Elderly Care Industry; Information Security; Privacy Protection; Technology Trust; Behavioral Research; Blockchain; Decision Making; Decision Theory; Digital Storage; Least Squares Approximations; Security Of Data; Social Aspects; Adoption Intention; Block-chain; Blockchain Adoption Intention; Elderly Care; Elderly Care Industry; Government Supports; Privacy Protection; Technology Trusts; Technology-organization-environment Frameworks; Top Management Support; Surveys; Adaptive Management; Decision Making; Elderly Care; Financial System; Industrial Technology; Information And Communication Technology; Organizational Framework; Technological Development; Technology Adoption","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Decision making; Decision theory; Digital storage; Least squares approximations; Security of data; Social aspects; Adoption intention; Block-chain; Blockchain adoption intention; Elderly care; Elderly care industry; Government supports; Privacy protection; Technology trusts; Technology-organization-environment frameworks; Top management support; Surveys; adaptive management; decision making; elderly care; financial system; industrial technology; information and communication technology; organizational framework; technological development; technology adoption","Funding text 1: This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 7213000060 ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71771075 ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71771077 .; Funding text 2: This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 7213000060 ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71771075 ; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 71771077.","Vest, Joshua R., Adoption of Health Information Technology Among US Nursing Facilities, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, 20, 8, pp. 995-1000.e4, (2019); Hammi, Mohamed Tahar, Bubbles of Trust: A decentralized blockchain-based authentication system for IoT, Computers and Security, 78, pp. 126-142, (2018); Shi, Shuyun, Applications of blockchain in ensuring the security and privacy of electronic health record systems: A survey, Computers and Security, 97, (2020); Hipaa Breaches in 2019 A Year in Review, (2020); Tariq, Noshina, Blockchain and smart healthcare security: A survey, Procedia Computer Science, 175, pp. 615-620, (2020); Leung, Polly P.L., Digitalisation for optimising nursing staff demand modelling and scheduling in nursing homes, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 164, (2021); Dale, Maureen C., Geriatric-Specific Standards for Information Transfer Between Nursing Homes and Acute Care Hospitals, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, 21, 4, pp. 444-446, (2020); undefined; Kim, Kwang il, Digital technology to enable aging in place, Experimental Gerontology, 88, pp. 25-31, (2017); Tandon, Anushree, Blockchain in healthcare: A systematic literature review, synthesizing framework and future research agenda, Computers in Industry, 122, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","0160791X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117142937"

The results of this longitudinal study show that the salience and tone of news media coverage of CSR were positively related to corporate reputation, even though the news media coverage about CSR was predominantly negative. Thus, reputation was still strengthened even in the face of negative publicity. No effect of CSR communication through Facebook on corporate reputation was found.

Research on the complementary effects of direct and indirect involvement is still in a blank state in China, which limits the external validity and accumulation of employee participation theory. The present study aimed to investigate the complementary effects of employee direct involvement and indirect involvement on the firm’s financial performance. Although previous research suggests that the influence of employee direct or indirect involvement on corporate financial performance has been examined separately, it is unclear whether the association between employee direct involvement and indirect involvement is complementary or conflictual. Based on strategic human resource management theory, we semantically encode 2,680 corporate social responsibility reports and the annual reports of 268 state-owned listed enterprises published from 2014 to 2018 via content analysis method, and the economic effects of employee direct involvement and indirect involvement were concurrently measured. We use configuration theory to explore the complementary effects between employee direct involvement and indirect involvement. Our results reveal that (1) employee involvement in Chinese enterprises was unbalanced, (2) both employee direct involvement and indirect involvement were positively related to enterprise’s financial performance, and (3) there is a complementary effect between the two forms of employee involvement.

Sourced from wind, a clean and free renewable resource, wind energy does not act as a pollution vector unlike power plants which operate on fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas. With environmental protection and sustainability at the forefront of our global society with a concentrated effort for corporate social responsibility, more focus is placed on renewable technologies such as wind turbines. After solar energy, wind energy is currently one of the cheapest forms of electrical energy to produce, and this number can be further reduced. Wind farms requires substantial parcels of land as wind turbines must be spaced approximately seven times their rotor diameter apart from each other, and the larger the wind turbines are the larger this spacing becomes, requiring even more real estate. As such, a method is sought to increase the amount of electrical energy each wind turbine can produce without altering efficiency or size. If the amount of power that a wind farm can produce is to be increased but neither the size of the wind farm's physical location can be increased for additional wind turbine placement nor the size of the wind turbines themselves increased, then the electrical power can be increased by utilizing a novel Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) design. This modified wind turbine design features an additional independent rotor behind the original rotor which allows for more power-generation opportunities. The scope of this research is to evaluate the performance of a novel Cascaded Dual-Rotor Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine (CDR-HAWT) and compare it with the performance of a typical single-rotor HAWT. For this purpose, the CDR-HAWT was fabricated with the same critical dimensions and electrical tolerances as a typical single-rotor HAWT. In order to compare the performances of the two independent wind turbines, the CDR-HAWT along with a typical HAWT with identical generator size, nacelle and hub size, and blade geometry, are mounted onto the bed of a truck to be tested at different wind speeds. The voltage and power produced by the two wind turbines are measured across a resistive load using a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO). From testing it is determined that the CDR- HAWT produces approximately 84 percent additional power as compared to a typical single-rotor HAWT.","Environmental Sustainability; Power Generation; Renewable Energy Source; Wind Energy; Wind Turbine; Digital Storage; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Electric Power Transmission Networks; Electric Utilities; Energy Policy; Environmental Technology; Fossil Fuel Power Plants; Fossil Fuels; Gas Plants; Population Statistics; Rural Areas; Social Aspects; Solar Energy; Sustainable Development; Wind Turbines; Dual Rotors; Electrical Energy; Environmental Sustainability; Horizontal-axis Wind Turbines; Performance; Power; Power- Generations; Renewable Energy Source; Turbine Designs; Wind Farm; Wind Power","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Population statistics; Rural areas; Social aspects; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Wind turbines; Dual rotors; Electrical energy; Environmental sustainability; Horizontal-axis wind turbines; Performance; Power; Power- generations; Renewable energy source; Turbine designs; Wind farm; Wind power","","National Wind Watch; Disvocer Wind Energy; General Electric 1 5 Mw Series; Nordex Acciona Windpower","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665412629","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119422634"

The COVID-19 has disrupted the normal teaching-learning role across the world and has put everyone in a nightmare. HEIs are now requesting students to take up MOOCs to explore and attain knowledge and the same is even followed by the corporate institutions. MOOCs are one of the crisis management solutions to ensure that education is continuous and not disrupted. Design/methodology/approach: The data included in this research has been collected from students of HEIs across India using a convenient sampling method. The collected data was exposed to a factor analysis using a principal component analysis (PCA) technique to reduce multiple dimensions. Findings: The various stakeholders such as the government, HEIs and the MOOC providers have to play a crucial role in developing intellectual human assets for the nation’s growth and progression by extending flexible and cost-effective learning facilities. Education should be free to boost up the learning motivation, and hence it is the responsibility of the stakeholders to provide few courses free of cost, which will increase the rate of enrolment and student participation. Research limitations/implications: From the research, it is well understood that MOOCs are useful to keep oneself updated with the market and industry trends especially when the world is focusing on business analytics, artificial intelligence and other technologically driven topics and concepts. Practical implications: The present study contributes to the growing body of evidence that MOOCs play an important role in providing flexibility in learning. In the future, if there are similar crisis, which will disrupt education, then the best alternative will be MOOC through which many stakeholders will benefit. Education should be free to boost up the learning motivation, and hence it is the responsibility of the stakeholders to provide few courses free of cost, which will increase the rate of enrolment and student participation. Social implications: Education is a service for the society which will have a long-term positive impact on improving the standard of living of the people. Hence, MOOCs can be one of the educational elements to provide learning opportunities to all age groups. Originality/value: This study has explored the perception of MOOCs among the students of HEIs in India in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the available data provided by the Global Findex database, and some findings after more than one year of COVID-19 crisis we outlined the main aspects of financial digitization, by categories of people and countries. At the same time, we identified the challenges and problems during the pandemic that significantly adjusted the consumption pattern of citizens and increased the need for on-line access for financial transactions. Starting from the analysis of the inequality of access to financial instruments in the last years, from the informational asymmetry in financial education and the challenges of the pandemic period, we underlined the main coordinates of changing the model of sustainable financial inclusion—based on five pillars—access, education, support tools, CSR and resilience. The research results highlight the need for convergence in providing opportunities to consider financial inclusion as a public good and an active tool to increase consumers’ satisfaction and the quality of life of individuals.","Cluster Analysis; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitalization; Financial Education; Financial Inclusion; Principal Component Analysis; Banking; Cluster Analysis; Corporate Social Responsibility; Financial Provision; Financial Services; Gender Disparity; Labor Market; Life Satisfaction; Principal Component Analysis; Quality Of Life; Access To Information; Age; Article; Bank Account; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Data Base; Digital Divide; Digitization; Economic Well-being; Education; Financial Inclusion; Financial Management; Gender Inequality; Information Asymmetry; Job Market; Pandemic; Postpandemic; Psychological Resilience; Social Responsibility; Vulnerable Population; Human; Sex Factor; Covid-19; Humans; Pandemics; Quality Of Life; Sars-cov-2; Sex Factors","banking; cluster analysis; corporate social responsibility; financial provision; financial services; gender disparity; labor market; life satisfaction; principal component analysis; quality of life; access to information; age; Article; bank account; coronavirus disease 2019; data base; digital divide; digitization; economic well-being; education; financial inclusion; financial management; gender inequality; information asymmetry; job market; pandemic; postpandemic; psychological resilience; social responsibility; vulnerable population; human; sex factor; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Factors","","2020 Overview Universal Financial Access by 2020 World Bank; World Development Report 2021 Data for Better Lives, (2021); Is Digital Financial Inclusion Unlocking Growth, (2021); Building Resilience Through Financial Inclusion A Review of Existing Evidence and Knowledge Gaps, (2019); Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Measures and Financial Inclusion with A Supplement on Customer Due Diligence, (2017); IMF Working Papers, (2020); Mhlanga, David, Artificial intelligence in the industry 4.0, and its impact on poverty, innovation, infrastructure development, and the sustainable development goals: Lessons from emerging economies?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Financial Inclusion Advocacy Centre, (2020); Lutfi, Abdalwali, Digital financial inclusion sustainability in Jordanian context, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Lotfi, Afsaneh, The effect of intellectual capital on fraud in financial statements, TQM Journal, 34, 4, pp. 651-674, (2022)","","MDPI","16604601; 16617827","","","34682701","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117125712"

Now is the right time for constructive approaches and to apply ethics-by-design in order to develop and implement a safe and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) application. So far, no study has addressed the key research question: Where can corporate digital responsibility (CDR) be allocated, and how shall an adequate ethical framework be designed to support digital innovations in order to make full use of the potentials of digitization and AI? Therefore, the research on how best practices meet their corporate responsibility in the digital transformation process and the requirements of the EU for trustworthy AI and its human-friendly use is essential. Its transformation bears a high potential for companies, is critical for success and thus, requires responsible handling. This study generates data by conducting case studies and interviewing experts as part of the qualitative method to win profound insights into applied practice. It provides an assessment of demands stated in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations (SDGs), White Papers on AI by international institutions, European Commission and German Government requesting the consideration and protection of values and fundamental rights, the careful demarcation between machine (artificial) and human intelligence and the careful use of such technologies. The study discusses digitization and the impacts of AI in construction engineering from an ethical perspective. This research critically evaluates opportunities and risks concerning CDR in construction industry. To the author’s knowledge, no study has set out to investigate how CDR in construction could be conceptualized, especially in relation to digitization and AI, to mitigate digital transformation both in large, medium- and small-sized companies. This study applies a holistic, interdisciplinary, inclusive approach to provide guidelines for orientation and examine benefits as well as risks of AI. Furthermore, the goal is to define ethical principles which are key for success, resource-cost-time efficiency and sustainability using digital technologies and AI in construction engineering to enhance digital transformation. This study concludes that innovative corporate organizations starting new business models are more likely to succeed than those dominated by a more conservative, traditional attitude.","Ai; Cdr; Construction Engineering; Digital Transformation; Digitization; Ethics; Clock And Data Recovery Circuits (cdr Circuits); Construction Industry; Cost Engineering; Digital Twin; Philosophical Aspects; Sustainable Development; Construction Engineering; Constructive Approach; Corporate Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Digital Transformation; Ethical Perspectives; European Commission; New Business Models; Artificial Intelligence","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Construction industry; Cost engineering; Digital twin; Philosophical aspects; Sustainable development; Construction engineering; Constructive approach; Corporate responsibility; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Ethical perspectives; European Commission; New business models; Artificial intelligence","Funding text 1: That said, this study invites leaders and users of digitization and AI to take responsibility to shape the ethical framework for AI and to participate in international debates, e.g. EU-uniform concept for ethically justifiable AI, European Ethic Guidelines for trustworthy AI, European Data Strategy, Digital Europe and Digital Technologies Initiatives, European Green Deal, SDGs by the United Nations, Rome Call for Ethics and the centre for development and progress of AI, funded by German Ministry of Economic Affairs.; Funding text 2: I would like to thank all contributors and interviewed experts for their valuable support for this study.

The latter are geographic areas and policy issues lacking coverage because of the crisis of the commercial model of news provision. Three clusters of characteristics are used to streamline and compare business models: (1) revenue models, (2) patrons and their motives, and (3) legal frameworks for the incorporation of the organization. Hybrid business models are designed by mixing the principles underpinning the Benefit Corporation or the Low-profit Limited Liability Company (L3C), with the basic characteristics of commercial and non-profit news organizations. The term ethical advertising refers to promotional activities that non-profits and other organizations dedicated to social goals normally undertake, including marketing, fundraising, or public-awareness campaigns. Based on data published by the Internal Revenue Services, this article argues that a digital platform for ethical advertising could face a demand worth over $1 billion a year. Additionally, this platform could effectively match non-profits’ demand for an audience with a pro-social attitude with non-profit and hybrid news organizations’ need for additional revenue streams.","Benefit Corporation; Business Model; Corporate Social Responsibility; Hybrid Organization; Investigative Journalism; Local News; Low-profit Limited Liability Company; Media Organizations; Non-profit News Organization","","The authors would like to thank Roland Holzinger, Tales Tomaz and Spriha Dhanuka for comments and advice on drafts of this article.

Using panel data probit regression, and after controlling for country-level governance and institutional factors, the study finds that embedding environmental targets in corporate strategy does encourage corporate managers to design and develop eco-friendly products and services, and such firm-level commitments at the top motivates managers to promote, market, and label environmentally friendly products.

Globalization, the digital environment, bring new dimensions and increasingly diverse interpretations of security to life. These new approaches, while reducing the consistency of the concept, allow an understanding of individual attitudes towards security. In recent years, several researchers have analyzed the psychological dimension of security at a personal level and ontological security in relation to citizens, residents, employees and students; however, based on a review of research history, there is still a scientific gap with regard to the perspective of customers and consumers. Accepting the fact that market actors are increasingly taking their share of creating a secure environment, in our empirical study we focus on corporate involvement and contribution through an examination of consumers’ perceptions of security. Corporate security is originally a field supporting the smooth operation of the organization, but nowadays it has become an important element of corporate strategy and also a factor of competitiveness. Keeping that in mind, our objective is to get a picture of how consumers judge the contribution of companies to the general sense of security in Hungary, what security-related tasks they expect from the corporate actors, and how they feel about a company’s security-related performance. In our study, we develop the ontological security model of consumers, into which we integrate—next to the individual socio-psychological features and the macro-environmental elements—the dimension of the assessment of corporate performance, the possible components of which are analyzed during the quantitative primary research.","Consumer’s Ontological Security; Corporate Security Responsibility; Psychological Security; Competitiveness; Conceptual Framework; Data Interpretation; Digitization; Empirical Analysis; Globalization; Psychology; Security; Hungary","competitiveness; conceptual framework; data interpretation; digitization; empirical analysis; globalization; psychology; security; Hungary","","A Szubjektiv Biztonsagerzetet Befolyasolo Tenyezok Magyarorszagon, (2014); Zotova, Olga Yu, Psychological security as the foundation of personal psychological wellbeing (analytical review), Psychology in Russia: State of the Art, 11, 2, pp. 100-113, (2018); Intercultural Human Rights Law Review, (2006); Newman, Edward, Critical human security studies, Review of International Studies, 36, 1, pp. 77-94, (2010); Environmental Change and Human Security Recognising and Acting on Hazard Impacts, (2008); Anthropological Measurements of Philosophical Research, (2018); Brown, Steven P., A new look at psychological climate and its relationship to job involvement, effort, and performance, Journal of Applied Psychology, 81, 4, pp. 358-368, (1996); Edmondson, Amy C., Psychological Safety: The History, Renaissance, and Future of an Interpersonal Construct, Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1, pp. 23-43, (2014); Baeva, Irina A., The psychological safety of the educational environment and the psychological well-being of Russian secondary school pupils and teachers, Psychology in Russia: State of the Art, 8, 1, pp. 86-99, (2015); Mahrous, Amira M., Physical characteristics and perceived security in urban parks: Investigation in the Egyptian context, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 9, 4, pp. 3055-3066, (2018)","","MDPI","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114615156"

In the marketing field, companies are increasingly gamifying their mobile apps and online platforms to enrich their customers’ digital experiences. Whilst there has been a number of systematic studies examining the influence of gamification on user engagement across different fields, none has reviewed its role in brand value co-creation. Following a systematic literature review procedure via the online research platform EBSCOhost, this paper is the first to survey a set of empirical studies examining the role and impact of gamification on brand value co-creation. A final pool of 32 empirical studies implies the existence of four types of activities that are co-created by online users and positively influenced by gamification, namely: customer service, insights sharing, word-of-mouth, and random task. Moreover, this paper highlights the major game dynamics driving these activities, the key findings of each of the covered studies and their main theoretical underpinnings. Lastly, a set of noteworthy research directions for future related studies are suggested, comprising the exploration of novel game elements, and new co-creation activities related to corporate social responsibilities and physical commercial operations.","Brand Value Co-creation; Consumer Behaviour; Consumer Motivation; Crowdsourcing; Customer Engagement; Customer Value Creation; Gamification; Marketing; Online Users; Sharing Economy; Commercial Operation; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Customer Services; Empirical Studies; Online Platforms; Systematic Literature Review; Systematic Study; User Engagement; Gamification","Commercial operation; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Customer services; Empirical studies; Online platforms; Systematic literature review; Systematic study; User engagement; Gamification","","Huotari, Kai, A definition for gamification: anchoring gamification in the service marketing literature, Electronic Markets, 27, 1, pp. 21-31, (2017); Schoech, Dick J., Gamification for Behavior Change: Lessons from Developing a Social, Multiuser, Web-Tablet Based Prevention Game for Youths, Journal of Technology in Human Services, 31, 3, pp. 197-217, (2013); Tobon, Sandra, Gamification and online consumer decisions: Is the game over?, Decision Support Systems, 128, (2020); Deterding, Sebastian, From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining ""gamification, pp. 9-15, (2011); Gamification by Design Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps, (2011); Patricio, Rui, Gamification approaches to the early stage of innovation, Creativity and Innovation Management, 27, 4, pp. 499-511, (2018); International Journal of Serious Games, (2015); Szendrői, László, Gamification in for-profit organisations: A mapping study, Business: Theory and Practice, 21, 2, pp. 598-612, (2020); Buckley, Patrick, Gamification and student motivation, Interactive Learning Environments, 24, 6, pp. 1162-1175, (2016); Mitchell, Robert, Gamification and the impact of extrinsic motivation on needs satisfaction: Making work fun?, Journal of Business Research, 106, pp. 323-330, (2020)","","MDPI","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114208166"

As I demonstrate in this article, the massive collection of individuals’ data online, an inherent feature of surveillance capitalism, makes it virtually impossible for individuals to self-manage their privacy and security. In fact, corporate interests who benefit from the ubiquitous digital surveillance online purposely obscure their activities, complicating the ability of users to accurately perceive the degree of risk inherent in online activities. Our concepts of privacy and responsibility online further disempower users and dissuade them from demanding privacy as a human right. While some individually initiated protective behaviors can be efficacious in curbing localized harm, significant legal reforms are needed for lasting privacy protection and harm reduction for all users. My discussion demonstrates how, as writing teachers, we can help students to become advocates for legal and regulatory reforms through completing assignments, such as the tracking report described herein, that help them to experience and, thus, more accurately read the risks resulting from compromised privacy in digital spaces.","Cliqz Privacy Browser; Digital Spaces; Ghostery; Legal Models; Privacy; Risk Perception; Surveillance Capitalism","","","Beck, Estee N., The Invisible Digital Identity: Assemblages in Digital Networks, Computers and Composition, 35, pp. 125-140, (2015); undefined, (2021); undefined, (2021); Bietz, Matthew J., Privacy perceptions and norms in youth and adults, Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology, 7, 1, pp. 93-103, (2019); Obfuscation A User S Guide for Privacy and Protest, (2015); Cagle, Lauren E., Surveilling Strangers: The Disciplinary Biopower of Digital Genre Assemblages, Computers and Composition, 52, pp. 67-78, (2019); undefined, (2017); Chen, Hongliang H., Understanding third-person perception about Internet privacy risks, New Media and Society, 23, 3, pp. 419-437, (2021); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","87554615","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111517901"

Further, this study proposed antecedents to awareness, including; level of fandom, overall season-ticket holder (STH) satisfaction, perceptions of on-field performance, live game viewership frequency, televised game viewership frequency, and digital channel interaction frequency. A survey was used to collect data from STHs across three professional sports teams (n = 8,414). Fan recall of charity partners was low with 1.3% recalling three, 3.5% recalling two, and 9.6% able to recall at least one charity partner. Of the antecedents, overall STH satisfaction and frequency of live game viewership were the most influential while, perceptions of on-field performance returned a significant and negative result. It is advocated sports teams reduce the number of charity partners and charity managers focus communication efforts on more contented STHs who attend live games regularly.","","","","Charity Partners, (2020); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Annual Report, (2025); Baena-Graciá, Verónica, The importance of CSR practices carried out by sport teams and its influence on brand love: The Real Madrid Foundation, Social Responsibility Journal, 14, 1, pp. 61-79, (2018); Bennett, Roger, Sports sponsorship, spectator recall and false consensus, European Journal of Marketing, 33, 3-4, pp. 291-313, (1999); Bergkvist, Lars, The predictive validity of multiple-item versus single-item measures of the same constructs, Journal of Marketing Research, 44, 2, pp. 175-184, (2007); Bergkvist, Lars, Leveraged marketing communications: a framework for explaining the effects of secondary brand associations, AMS Review, 6, 3-4, pp. 157-175, (2016); Bigné, Enrique, Cause-related marketing influence on consumer responses: The moderating effect of cause-brand fit, Journal of Marketing Communications, 18, 4, pp. 265-283, (2012); Biscaia, Rui Daniel Gaspar Neto, Sport sponsorship: The relationship between team loyalty, sponsorship awareness, attitude toward the sponsor, and purchase intentions, Journal of Sport Management, 27, 4, pp. 288-302, (2013); Red Sox Foundation, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","14720817; 14791838","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099249279"

Under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals whose work could be done with digital tools were directed to work remotely. Performing work duties at a distance from the workplace, colleagues, and supervisors affects the workplace resources available to employees and can have an impact on employee well-being. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between remote working and employee well-being. The research hypothesis was that there is a relationship between employee well-being and the level of digitisation of work performed, as measured by the frequency of remote working. This article presents the results of empirical research conducted in January 2021, using the CAWI method, on a representative sample of Polish workers (n = 1000). An exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression were carried out. The results point to the three-dimensional nature of employee well-being, which includes workplace relationships, health, and work–life balance. Based on the results, working exclusively remotely was shown to negatively affect well-being in terms of workplace relationships and work–life balance. There was no statistically significant association between remote working and subjective health assessment. The results have important implications for the management of employee well-being in remote working settings. Originality/value lies in the fact that the article provides practical guidance in planning hybrid work arrangements.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Covid-19; Digital Work; Employee Well-being; Digital Devices; Factor Analysis; Industrial Relations; Logistic Regression; Empirical Research; Exploratory Factor Analysis; Health Assessments; Performing Work; Practical Guidance; Quality Of Life; Remote Working; Representative Sample; Personnel","Digital devices; Factor analysis; Industrial relations; Logistic regression; Empirical research; Exploratory factor analysis; Health assessments; Performing work; Practical guidance; Quality of life; Remote working; Representative sample; Personnel","Funding: This research was funded by the National Science Centre in Poland under Grant “Compensation justice”, 2016/21/B/ HS4/02992.","Kniffin, Kevin M., COVID-19 and the workplace: Implications, issues, and insights for future research and action., American Psychologist, 76, 1, pp. 63-77, (2021); Bakker, Arnold Bastiaan, Rumination about COVID-19 and employee well-being: The role of playful work design., Canadian Psychology, (2020); Möhring, Katja, The COVID-19 pandemic and subjective well-being: longitudinal evidence on satisfaction with work and family, European Societies, 23, S1, pp. S601-S617, (2021); Raport Trendy Hr 2020polska Global Human Capital Trends 2020 Firmy Odpowiedzialne W Praktyce; Navickas, Valentinas, Paradigm shift in the concept of corporate social responsibility: COVID-19, Green Finance, 3, 2, pp. 138-152, (2021); Kowalski, Tina H.P., Well-being and HRM in the changing workplace, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 28, 16, pp. 2229-2255, (2017); Bryson, Alex, Does employees’ subjective well-being affect workplace performance?, Human Relations, 70, 8, pp. 1017-1037, (2017); Raport Global Human Capital Trends 2021; Tuzovic, Sven, The influence of social distancing on employee well-being: a conceptual framework and research agenda, Journal of Service Management, 32, 2, pp. 145-160, (2021); Prasad, K.

This paper addresses the following research question: How can socially-minded data-intensive innovation be pursued in the private sector? It reports the findings of a series of five focus groups to explore the role of public deliberation in informing ethical data practices in banking. The findings indicate that deliberative forms of public engagement present valuable opportunities to incorporate diverse views and perspectives and to enable critical reflection on organisational practices and the trajectory of innovation.

However, the use of social media for corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication is relatively new to the existing literature. Likewise, the impact of CSR communication through social media (CSR-S) on consumer emotions and behavior is, to date, underexplored. To address this, the present research aims to test the relationship of CSR-S on brand admiration and consumer purchase intention. The study proposes a direct relationship between CSR-S and purchase intention with a mediating effect of brand admiration. The data were collected from the banking consumers of Pakistan through a self-administered questionnaire. The authors distributed 800 questionnaires and received 463 questionnaires useful for data analysis, so the present research study response rate was around 59%. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique in AMOS. The results revealed that CSR-S is positively related to purchase intention (β = 0.233). The results further showed that brand admiration partially mediates this relationship (β = 0.079). The survey respondents confirmed that their bank’s CSR communication helps enhance their purchase likelihood and their feelings of admiration for their bank. These findings will help policymakers at banking institutions better understand the importance of CSR communication on different social media platforms to achieve consumer-related outcomes.","Brand Admiration; Consumer Behavior; Csr; Digital Transformation; Purchase Intention; Social Media; Sustainability","","","Troise, Ciro, The Use of Digital Media for Marketing, CSR Communication and Stakeholder Engagement, pp. 161-174, (2021); Prabhakar, Guru M., Social media information benefits, knowledge management and smart organizations, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 264-272, (2019); Social Media Vs Traditional Mediamake the Transition to Digital Marketing; Brinkman, Craig S., Social achievement goals and social media, Computers in Human Behavior, 111, (2020); S, Sreejesh, Consumer response towards social media advertising: Effect of media interactivity, its conditions and the underlying mechanism, International Journal of Information Management, 54, (2020); Blankespoor, Elizabeth, Firm communication and investor response: A framework and discussion integrating social media, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 68-69, pp. 80-87, (2018); Carr, Caleb T., Social Media: Defining, Developing, and Divining, Atlantic Journal of Communication, 23, 1, pp. 46-65, (2015); Tham, Aaron, Social media influence on tourists’ destination choice: importance of context, Tourism Recreation Research, 45, 2, pp. 161-175, (2020); Digital 2020 3 8 Billion People Use Social Media, (2020); Social Network Usage Growth Statistics how Many People Use Social Media in 2022, (2021)","","MDPI AG","07181876","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105085485"

Several frameworks and legal regulations have been adopted to clarify and define the various ethical challenges in digital contexts. These initiatives often accentuate one of three components: data security, data governance, or digital strategy. However, an integrated approach is required to meet the current demand for an ethical and sustainable approach to digitalization and address the growing number of challenges occurring in handling data and related peripheral components. This paper develops the concept of an integrated framework to incorporate all relevant aspects of digital ethics by combining three categories of digital contexts: law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. The core of this integrated framework, the Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework (FSDEF), consists of two boundary conditions of sustainable development: social thresholds of justice and ecological planetary boundaries. It also incorporates numerous other frameworks and standards, including value-based engineering and IEEE standards.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digital Ethics; Sustainability; Environmental Regulations; Ieee Standards; Philosophical Aspects; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporates; Digital Ethics; Digitisation; Framework Regulation; Integrated Frameworks; Legal Regulation; Private Companies; Public Institution; Public-private; Sustainable Development","Environmental regulations; IEEE Standards; Philosophical aspects; Corporate digital responsibility; Corporates; Digital ethics; Digitisation; Framework Regulation; Integrated frameworks; Legal regulation; Private companies; Public institution; Public-private; Sustainable development","The authors would like to thank the Foundation at the University of Fribourg for promoting and fostering the FSDEF.

In this study, we examined the concept of stakeholder engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and identified how organizations engage stakeholders in their CSR communication by analyzing successful CSR programs. Two coders conducted a content analysis of 146 Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) Silver Anvil Award-winning CSR campaigns implemented during the past ten years. The results show that many organizations have engaged stakeholders in their CSR programs in various ways to increase awareness about social issues, change stakeholder behavior, and create favorable attitudes toward the organizations. As for CSR communication strategies, stakeholder response strategies were frequently observed, which is relevant to the two-way asymmetric communication model. Many organizations receive feedback from their stakeholders and demonstrate how they integrate their stakeholders’ concerns. The result also shows that social media is widely used for digital engagement. However, despite its potential to become an interactive, dialogic space, response strategy is used more often than involvement strategy. Although co-creating a CSR strategy with stakeholders and making a shared decision (i.e., stakeholder involvement strategy) is ideal for building a mutually beneficial relationship between an organization and its stakeholders, few organizations have employed this strategy. This study also found that partnership is a common stakeholder engagement strategy in CSR communication. Many organizations have used third-party endorsement and engaged nonprofits, opinion leaders, and social media influencers in their CSR communication.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Csr Communication; Engagement In Csr; Prsa Silver Anvil Award; Stakeholder Engagement","","","Ecomagination Ten Years Later Proving that Efficiency and Economics Go Hand in Hand, (2015); Levis Tunes into Teen Issues Music and Gun Violence, (2001); Where to Recycle Your Jeans 2019; Bhattacharya, C.

In the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what direction should the CSR strategy pursue? In the electronics industries in Korea and China, are there any differences in CSR attributes? In this study, we start with some of these basic questions. Considering the promotional and actual costs incurred from CSR activities, CSR strategy are not an issue that can be easily determined from the corporate perspective. However, now it is essential for companies to carry out CSR and sustainable development goals (SDGs) activities, and businesses cannot overlook social issues either. Companies cannot pursue only growth through corporate interests without social value. In this study, we derive three attributes of CSR fit, CSR sustainability, and CSR impact to verify the authenticity of CSR activities. Moreover, we demonstrated the impact of these three attributes on CSR authenticity for the electronics industries in Korea and China. As a result of empirical testing, most of three attributes above mentioned (i.e., CSR fit, CSR sustainability, and CSR impact) produce meaningful results for CSR authenticity. However, CSR sustainability was rejected for the Korea sample, and CSR fit was rejected for the Chinese sample, showing some differences between the two countries. Meanwhile, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution had strong partial mediating effects between CSR attributes and CSR authenticity. This means that digital transformation can be an important pathway to achieve CSR authenticity and suggests that important mediating effects can eventually lead to a firm’s competitiveness.","China; Csr Authenticity; Digital Transformation; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Korea; Mediating Effect; Competitiveness; Digitization; Electronics Industry; Sustainable Development Goal; China; Korea","competitiveness; digitization; electronics industry; Sustainable Development Goal; China; Korea","","Kim, Songmi, The Effect of CSR fit and CSR authenticity on the brand attitude, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); Du, Shuili, Corporate Social Responsibility, Multi-faceted Job-Products, and Employee Outcomes, Journal of Business Ethics, 131, 2, pp. 319-335, (2015); Luo, Xueming, Corporate social responsibility, customer Satisfaction, and market value, Journal of Marketing, 70, 4, pp. 1-18, (2006); Luo, Xueming, The debate over doing good: Corporate social performance, strategic marketing levers, and firm-Idiosyncratic risk, Journal of Marketing, 73, 6, pp. 198-213, (2009); Choi, Daeheon, An economic analysis of corporate social responsibility in Korea, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 9, (2019); Porter, Michael E., Strategy & society: The link between competitive advantage and corporate social responsibility, Harvard Business Review, 84, 12, pp. 78-92, (2006); Harvard Business Review, (2011); Vilanova, Marc, Exploring the nature of the relationship between CSR and competitiveness, Journal of Business Ethics, 87, SUPPL. 1, pp. 57-69, (2009); Yoo, Dongho, The effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) Fit and CSR consistency on company evaluation: The role of CSR support, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 8, (2018); Park, Jongchul, Corporate social responsibilities, consumer trust and corporate reputation: South Korean consumers' perspectives, Journal of Business Research, 67, 3, pp. 295-302, (2014)","","MDPI AG","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112127118"

To do so, we investigate large Italian firms’ discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms’ Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms’ ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms’ issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data.","Article; Community; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Digital Innovation; Entropy Based Null Model; Environmental Sustainability; Human; Information; Italy; Management; Model; Online System; Pandemic; Quality Control; Research; Safety; Semantic Web; Social Media; Social Responsibility; Epidemiology; Covid-19; Humans; Pandemics; Safety; Social Media; Social Responsibility","Article; community; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; digital innovation; entropy based null model; environmental sustainability; human; information; Italy; management; model; online system; pandemic; quality control; research; safety; semantic web; social media; social responsibility; epidemiology; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Safety; Social Media; Social Responsibility","","Ratten, Vanessa, Coronavirus (covid-19) and entrepreneurship: changing life and work landscape, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, pp. 503-516, (2020); Im, Jongho, COVID-19, social distancing, and risk-averse actions of hospitality and tourism consumers: A case of South Korea, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 20, (2021); Hussain Shahzad, Syed Jawad, From pandemic to systemic risk: contagion in the U.S. tourism sector, Current Issues in Tourism, 25, 1, pp. 34-40, (2022); Shin, Hakseung, The impact of hotel CSR for strategic philanthropy on booking behavior and hotel performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tourism Management, 85, (2021); Akinwale, Yusuf Opeyemi, Technology innovation and financial performance of MSMEs during Covid-19 lockdown in Dammam area of Saudi Arabia: A case of food and beverage sector, International Journal of Technological Learning, Innovation and Development, 12, 2, pp. 136-152, (2020); Chen, Xihui Haviour, FinTech and commercial banks' performance in China: A leap forward or survival of the fittest?, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 166, (2021); Ahmad Qadri, Usman, How to improve organizational performance during Coronavirus: A serial mediation analysis of organizational learning culture with knowledge creation, Knowledge and Process Management, 28, 2, pp. 141-152, (2021); Zhang, Ting, Working from home: small business performance and the COVID-19 pandemic, Small Business Economics, 58, 2, pp. 611-636, (2022); Seven, Ünal, World equity markets and COVID-19: Immediate response and recovery prospects, Research in International Business and Finance, 56, (2021); Ding, Ding, Building stock market resilience through digital transformation: using Google trends to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Frontiers of Business Research in China, 14, 1, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","34314432","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111654374"

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States","Background: There is an urgent need to fill the gap of scalable cognitive assessment tools for preschool children to enable identification of children at-risk of sub-optimal development and to support their timely referral into interventions. We present the associations between growth in early childhood, a well-established marker of cognitive development, and scores on a novel digital cognitive assessment tool called DEvelopmental Assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP) on a sample of 3-year old pre-schoolers from a rural region in north India. Methods: Between February 2018 and March 2019, 1359 children from the Sustainable Programme Incorporating Nutrition and Games (SPRING) programme were followed up at 3-years age and data on DEEP, anthropometry and a clinical developmental assessment, the Bayley's Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSID-III) was collected. DEEP data from 200 children was used to train a machine learning algorithm to predict their score on the cognitive domain of BSID-III. The DEEP score of the remaining 1159 children was then predicted using this algorithm to examine the cross-sectional and prospective association of growth with the DEEP score. Findings: The magnitude of the concurrent positive association between height-for-age and cognitive z-scores in 3-year olds was similar when cognition was measured by BSID-III (0.20 standard deviations increase for every unit change in specifically age-adjusted height (HAZ), 95% CI = 0.06–0.35) and DEEP (0.26 CI, 0.11–0.41). A similar positive prospective relationship was found between growth at 18 (0.21 CI, 0.17–0.26) and 12-months (0.18 CI, 0.13–0.23) and DEEP score measured at 3-years. Additionally, the relationship between growth and cognitive development was found to be dependant on socioeconomic status (SES). Interpretation: In this study, we suggest the utility of DEEP, a scalable, digital cognitive assessment tool, to measure cognition in preschool children. Further validation in different and larger datasets is necessary to confirm our findings. Funding: The SPRING Programme was funded through a Wellcome Trust programme grant and the follow-up study by the Corporate Social Responsibility initiative grant from Madura Microfinance Ltd.","Cognitive Development; Digital Assessment; Early Childhood Development; Serious Game; Algorithm; Anthropometry; Article; Child; Childhood; Clinical Assessment; Cognitive Development; Controlled Study; Female; Follow Up; Genetic Marker; Human; Human Experiment; India; Infant; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; Nutrition; Preschool Child; Proof Of Concept; Social Responsibility; Social Status; Spring; Toddler; Trust","algorithm; anthropometry; article; child; childhood; clinical assessment; cognitive development; controlled study; female; follow up; genetic marker; human; human experiment; India; infant; machine learning; major clinical study; male; nutrition; preschool child; proof of concept; social responsibility; social status; spring; toddler; trust","Funding text 1: These studies were funded through two awards: a Wellcome Trust programme grant for the SPRING Programme and a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative grant from Madura Microfinance Ltd for the follow-up study.; Funding text 2: Dr Sharma reports grants from Madura Microfinance Ltd and Wellcome Trusts, during the conduct of the study.

Among the most prominent is facilitating and promoting digital inclusivity. The idea of ’Digital Inclusivity’ in the scope of SDE is centred around the state government’s objective to enhance the competency and readiness of all communities for the digital economy through the development of digital skills and competencies, as well as promoting inclusive digital participation. The involvement of local organisations in the execution of SDE has drawn the attention of this research to analyse the role of CSR in driving digital inclusivity especially among the communities in rural Sarawak. Based on this objective, a case study design was applied to obtain a deeper understanding on how CSR is developed and implemented in the organisation being investigated. The analysis is based on the data triangulation of interviews with the organisation’s key CSR players and official documents. This article contributes to the existing literature by supplying new insights on Carroll’s (1991) fourpart components to defining CSR and the weightings based on the perceived importance by the organisation being investigated. The findings also shed light on the contextual considerations that the organisation takes into account in its CSR development; parallel to its effort in accommodating the needs and requirements shaped by the SDE environment.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr) In Malaysia; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr) In Sarawak; Csr Sensemaking; Digital Economy; Digital Inclusivity; Organisational Sensemaking; Sarawak Digital Economy (sde)","","The authors wish to express the utmost appreciation to the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) and last but not least, Sarawak Information Systems Sdn.

While momentum is growing towards regulating platform companies, there is little consensus on how to ensure effective enforcement of crowdworkers' labour rights across jurisdictions. The paper contributes to the debate on an adequate normative response to this complex model of work organisation by revisiting the regulatory framework for global supply chains (GSCs). It carries out a comparison between crowdwork platforms and GSCs, finding that these business models share certain structural commonalities and pose a similar set of problems to transnational labour governance. Crucially, both digital platforms and lead firms in GSCs are a stark manifestation of the ways in which multinational companies exert (direct or indirect) influence on the working conditions downstream their production chains, without incurring any legal liability therefor. The central argument of the paper is that crowdwork platforms should be made legally accountable for ensuring adherence to labour standards in their ecosystem. Lessons learned from regulation of GSCs show that corporate social responsibility instruments and the soft-law human rights due diligence framework are insufficient to improve labour standards. The paper concludes with a claim for hardening the current regulatory framework and going beyond transparency and reporting obligations.","Code Of Conduct; Crowdwork; Digital Labour Platforms; Due Diligence; Global Supply Chains","","","Al-Ani, Ayad, Rebalancing interests and power structures on crowdworking platforms, Internet Policy Review, 5, 2, (2016); Work on Digital Labour Platforms in Ukraine Issues and Policy Perspectives, (2018); Alkhatib, Ali, Examining crowd work and gig work through the historical lens of piecework, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2017-May, pp. 4599-4616, (2017); Comparative Labor Law Policy Journal, (2016); Aloisi, Antonio, The role of european institutions in promoting decent work in the “collaborative economy”, Research for Development, pp. 161-182, (2018); Quaderni Del Premio «giorgio Rota», (2020); Amengual, Matthew, Editorial Essay: Introduction to a Special Issue on Improving Private Regulation of Labor in Global Supply Chains: Theory and Evidence, ILR Review, 73, 4, pp. 809-816, (2020); Putting Labour in Its Place Labour Process Analysis and Global Value Chains, (2015); Anner, Mark S., Predatory purchasing practices in global apparel supply chains and the employment relations squeeze in the Indian garment export industry, International Labour Review, 158, 4, pp. 705-727, (2019); Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, (2013)","","Societa Editrice Il Mulino","1120947X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128695031"

Yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the “black box”. Central to understanding the “black box” is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action; it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms. But an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society. If we permit AI to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? We find that over 160 ethical AI principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms. This maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide. We need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and AI governance. The paper seeks to harmonise and align approaches, illustrating the opportunities and threats of AI, while raising awareness of Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) as a potential collaborative mechanism to demystify governance complexity and to establish an equitable digital society.","Artificial Intelligence (ai) Governance; Complexity; Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digital Ethics And Trust; Equitable Digital Society; Financial Technology (fintech)","","This work was funded in part by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for the projects titled “FinTrust: Trust Engineering for the Financial Industry” (EP/R033595/1) and “Finclusion: verifiable credentials” part of Trusted Digital Infrastructure for Identification Systems Gates Foundation/Turing Institute (ESaPoNIS\100047).","Abbott, Ryan B., The reasonable computer: Disrupting the paradigm of tort liability, George Washington Law Review, 86, 1, pp. 1-45, (2018); Ackerman, John M., Co-governance for accountability: Beyond ""exit"" and ""voice, World Development, 32, 3, pp. 447-463, (2004); Aitken, Mhairi, Establishing a social licence for Financial Technology: Reflections on the role of the private sector in pursuing ethical data practices, Big Data and Society, 7, 1, (2020); Health Care Politics Ideological and Interest Group Barriers to Reform, (1975); Annual Review of Sociology, (1975); undefined, (2020); Arxiv 1808 07261v2 Cs Cy, (2019); undefined, (2020); Eu Set to Ban Surveillance Start Fines Under New AI Rules, (2021); Briggs, A.

Tracing, tracking, and storing information is most important for this. In this paper, the application of Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain) are hence discussed by presenting the case of professional Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) in Italy. Within the context of CE, prevention of electronic waste (WEEE) is extremely relevant as it is a fast-growing waste stream, and the products contain environmentally damaging substances as well as valuable and rare materials. The use of a proper combination of IoT and blockchain can help the producers to keep control on products until EEE end-of-life, while promoting CE strategies and supporting decision-making. Based on the outcomes of five interviews conducted in 2019 to companies of the EEE sector, potential improvements in the EEE end-of-use management are discussed. After providing the definition of requirements for both the technical solution and its testing are provided, three solution variations and the related business models are created and presented, as well as considerations on their environmental and economic impacts. The study shows how digital technologies can support the appropriate and circular management of EEE products and WEEE.","Bcot; Blockchain; Circular Economy; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitalization; Distributed Ledger Technology; Electric And Electronic Equipment; Iot; Sustainable Business Model; Weee; Decision Making; Digital Mapping; Economic Analysis; Electronic Equipment; Electronic Waste; Internet; Italy","decision making; digital mapping; economic analysis; electronic equipment; electronic waste; Internet; Italy","Funding: This research is part of EIT Climate-KIC project BlockWEEE (Project ID: 190796) funded by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union, under H2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

Even in 2021, its boundaries are evolving and researchers are linking the concept of CSR to different variables to achieve different outcomes. However, the concept of CSR in the healthcare sector is not well-explored in prior literature. The current study is an application of social identity theory to induce electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) from consumers for a specific brand, through its CSR engagement on social media (CSRS) and consumer-company identification (CCI) in the healthcare sector of an emerging economy. The data of the current survey were collected from different patients of four large hospitals in a large city through a self-administered questionnaire (paper-pencil technique). To validate different hypotheses of the current study, the authors employed the structural-equation-modeling (SEM) technique using AMOS software. The output of SEM analysis confirmed that CSRS positively influences eWOM, and CCI mediates this relationship. The findings of the current study will be helpful for policymakers in the healthcare industry to improve their understanding of CSRS and CCI, inducing eWOM through the lens of social identity theory.","Consumer-company Identification; Csr; Digital Platforms; Ewom; Healthcare Sector; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Health Care; Numerical Model; Social Media","business; corporate social responsibility; health care; numerical model; social media","","Tworzydło, Dariusz, Importance and role of CSR and stakeholder engagement strategy in polish companies in the context of activities of experts handling public relations, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 28, 1, pp. 64-70, (2021); Vǎrzaru, Anca Antoaneta, Rethinking corporate responsibility and sustainability in light of economic performance, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 5, pp. 1-21, (2021); Karaman, Abdullah S., CSR achievement, reporting, and assurance in the energy sector: Does economic development matter?, Energy Policy, 149, (2021); Decision, (2021); Halme, Minna, When Is There a Sustainability Case for CSR?

An instrument with four constructs (CSR-communication with stakeholders, CSR-knowledge management, CSR-strategy, and sustainable development) was prepared and served to entities from medium-sized enterprises. The collected data was analyzed by modeling the partial least squares structural equations using the least squares method. The results showed that all three constructs (CSR-communication with stakeholders, CSR-knowledge management, CSR-strategy) were positively and strongly associated with sustainable development model building in enterprises. The practical implications were intended to provide an understanding of behavior related to the development of business models oriented towards sustainable development in the small business sector. Research can help companies identify the advantages and disadvantages of retaining existing users and attracting new users by communicating with stakeholders, managing knowledge, and creating responsible strategies. This study enriches the literature by contributing to general knowledge about creating a model of sustainable development.

Design/methodology/approach: Taking Palazzo and Basu’s framework of scapes (2007) as a starting point, the paper explores the intersection between branding and CSR studies. After consideration of the lack of empirical studies on this subject, a content analysis of tweets generated from the campaign “Guerrieri” of Enel is performed. Findings: Findings show the dialogic bottom-up approach results are ineffective because of the hijacking of original intent of the company in implementing its CSR communication initiatives. That is to say that corporate brand (CB) strategies can be easily re-interpreted in social media-scape from an opposing perspective, raising the risk of digital hijacking and boycotting initiatives. Practical implications: From a practical standpoint, the study informs managers so that they can evaluate complex problems implicated in the creation of CSR activities aimed at engaging consumers and virtual communities. Besides, the paper would like to aid managers when they face discontent or activism, suggesting they should turn the attention of their stakeholders through a re-evaluation of relevant CSR activities, potentially leveraging on a loyal public, which has completely interiorised CB values and can act as brand ambassadors. Originality/value: The paper is one of the first attempts to study the nexus between CSR and CB in digitally empowering contexts, clarifying the crucial role of social media-scape.","Consumption; Content Analysis; Corporate Brand; Corporate Branding; Corporate Social Irresponsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility; Enel; Ethics; Identity; Social Media-scape; Value","","The authors gratefully acknowledge Naomi Sannino for useful insights and for helping with the collection of data. “Although the views and ideas expressed in this article are those of Agostino Vollero, Maria Palazzo, Alfonso Siano and Pantea Foroudi; “3.

This study contributes to the literature on CSR effectiveness in cultural organizations, by focusing on how digitization is influencing the attitude toward CSR disclosure, in order to provide suggestions for cultural managers, scholars, policymakers and practitioners alike. More specifically, this paper aims to examine stakeholders' perceptions in digital cultural organizations as a new form of social responsibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study that applies this perspective to the analysis of the digitization process through CSR, currently under way across cultural institutions around the world.","Cultural Organizations; Digital Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitization; Internet; Online Csr Communication; Stakeholder Engagement; Sustainable Development; Virtual Museums","","","Adams, Carol A., Accessibility and functionality of the corporate web site: Implications for sustainability reporting, Business Strategy and the Environment, 15, 4, pp. 275-287, (2006); Foreign Investment Decision Process, (1966); Academy of Management Journal, (1985); Social Responsibility and Accountability, (1975); Badia, Francesco, Quality and diffusion of social and sustainability reporting in Italian public utility companies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 11, (2020); Public Administration Review, (1964); Bedard, Stephanie Anne Nicole, Millennials' green consumption behaviour: Exploring the role of social media, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 6, pp. 1388-1396, (2018); Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, (1953); Our Common Future, (1987); Burns, Clare Jane M., Sustainability – A key to Australian finance directors improving their organisation's CSR culture, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 2, pp. 1164-1176, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","15353966; 15353958","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096674848"

However, during the COVID-19 crisis, export-led manufacturing firms around the world, particularly those in developing countries, have been forced to lay off workers and cope with VA-related problems, and serious survival problems have resulted in critical corporate social responsibility (CSR)-related challenges. Whereas limited research has discussed relevant issues in nonwestern contexts, we adopt a global perspective of business model and transactional cost theory, aiming to fill this gap by investigating the mechanisms among different dimensions of CSR implementation, firm performance, and VA herein. Based on a sample of listed Chinese manufacturing firms, the results show that the CSR technique dimension is negatively related to firm performance, that the CSR content dimension is positively related to firm performance, and that VA positively moderates the relationships of all three CSR dimensions to firm performance. The main contribution here is providing a more comprehensive understanding of how different CSR dimensions reflect firms’ multiple ethical behaviors, which influence their sustainable performance, respectively, thus enriching the existing knowledge of CSR studies in a new digital era riddled with uncertainties and complexities. We also offer practical implications for other export-led manufacturing firms in developing countries facing turbulent times.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Covid-19; Firm Performance; Value Appropriation; Complexity; Corporate Social Responsibility; Covid-19; Global Perspective; Numerical Model; Performance Assessment; Survival; Uncertainty Analysis; Worker Policing; China","complexity; corporate social responsibility; COVID-19; global perspective; numerical model; performance assessment; survival; uncertainty analysis; worker policing; China","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71772165), Zhejiang Federation of Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation (No.2021N70) and K.C.

Further, most of the prior studies have investigated CSR with a philanthropic viewpoint, but its importance in achieving marketing-related outcomes is something that is to date, underexplored. Hence, the aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of CSR communication through social media on consumer loyalty with the mediating effect of consumers’ brand admiration in the banking sector of Pakistan. The banking sector was selected due to the reason that this sector is homogenized in nature and creating consumers’ loyalty due to this homogenized character of this sector is challenging. The data of the present study were collected from different banking consumers through an adapted questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale. A total of 448 fully filled questionnaires were received which included 289 male and 159 female banking consumers. The results of the present study revealed that CSR communications through social media have a positive impact on consumer loyalty, and consum-ers’ brand admiration partially mediates this relationship. The findings of the present study would help policymakers from banking institutions to use CSR strategy from the perspective of marketing which is undoubtedly very important for every organization in the current digital age.","Admiration; Consumer Loyalty; Csr; Social Media; Sustainability; Banking; Corporate Social Responsibility; Marketing; Policy Making; Questionnaire Survey; Social Media; Pakistan","banking; corporate social responsibility; marketing; policy making; questionnaire survey; social media; Pakistan","","Palgrave Handbook of Corporate Social Responsibility, (2020); Lund, Niels Frederik, The power of social media storytelling in destination branding, Journal of Destination Marketing and Management, 8, pp. 271-280, (2018); Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility in the Digital Era, (2022); Waheed, Abdul, Effect of CSR and Ethical Practices on Sustainable Competitive Performance: A Case of Emerging Markets from Stakeholder Theory Perspective, Journal of Business Ethics, 175, 4, pp. 837-855, (2022); Freeman, R.

Digital regulation needs to take into account tacit elements of the value creation process, including unconscious competency, creativity, and intuitive anticipation, to assure the resulting network’s innovation growth. Digital society in developing countries is built on the ground of fact change of the economy and social relations, of transition towards an emerging market within the global offline network of interactions and online activities through Internet; the innovative growth imposes the evolution of managerial behavior and attitudes. The main objective of the paper is to obtain indications on the perception of intellectual capital by corporate managers. The exploratory study was carried out in Russian companies operating in different sectors, with the use of the open‐ended approach, including focused interviews and group discussion among experts, middle and senior managers from marketing or corporate governance background. The data were complemented by documentary analysis of descriptions of internal processes of the implementation of digital tools of accounting, which includes the human resources control applied for the remote work during the pandemic. Networking helps to coordinate functions between team members at remote work and between teams and administrators. The interviews demonstrated the administrative tendency to under‐estimate the non‐formalized factors of innovation activity, such as awareness of corporate strategy, creativity, motivation, and affective and behavioral components of communication of the persons involved in the enrichment of intellectual capital. The results show fuzzy boundaries between the intellectual capital components that are difficult to control. This difficulty provokes the preference for the use of “traditional” quantitative indicators that had been implemented at the stage of the financial digitalization, instead of developing new parameters or measuring approaches. The networking emerges synergetic effect if the administrators refuse their monopoly on the uncertainty zones and are oriented to construct the trustful atmosphere of personal responsibility within the network.","Cyber‐physical Systems; Digital Regulation; Intellectual Capital; Iot Integration; Multimedia Communication; Quality Of Experience; Smart Space; Tacit Knowledge; Value Creation; Commerce; Developing Countries; Digital Devices; Electric Current Regulators; Knowledge Management; Managers; Open Data; Behavioral Component; Coordinate Functions; Corporate Governance; Corporate Strategies; Network Infrastructure; Personal Responsibility; Quantitative Indicators; Value Creation Process; Process Control","Commerce; Developing countries; Digital devices; Electric current regulators; Knowledge management; Managers; Open Data; Behavioral component; Coordinate functions; Corporate governance; Corporate strategies; Network infrastructure; Personal responsibility; Quantitative indicators; Value creation process; Process control","Funding: The research was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in the framework of research project No. 16‐29‐12965/18.","Harvard Business Review, (1991); Personal Knowledge Towards A Post Critical Philosophy, (1958); Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, (1962); Organization Science, (1994); Harvard Business Review, (1986); Analysts Journal, (1958); Sveiby, Karl Erik, A knowledge-based theory of the firm to guide in strategy formulation, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2, 4, pp. 344-358, (2001); International Conference Gsom Emerging Markets Conference 2016, (2016); Interpersonal Competence and Organizational Effectiveness, (1962); Rganization and Innovation, (1965)","","MDPI AG","19995903","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101298099"

Design/methodology/approach: The data was collected using an online survey (n = 335) from online shopping consumers. This study used partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) techniques to empirically examine the proposed relationships. Findings: A lack of corporate privacy responsibility and regulatory protection can deprive consumers of privacy empowerment and damage consumer trust to trigger privacy concerns and subsequent defensive responses. Also, the fsQCA revealed five causal configurations to explain high consumer defensive behaviours. Research limitations/implications: This study identifies the importance of PRE theory in the privacy context. Consumer privacy concerns, privacy empowerment and trust are established as strong mediators between corporate/regulatory privacy protection efforts and consumer backlash. The application of fsQCA verified that consumer privacy behaviour can be better explained by different configurations of the same causal antecedents. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of increasing trust and privacy empowerment as mechanisms to manage privacy concerns and consumer backlash through responsible organisational and regulatory privacy protections. The importance of balancing power and responsibility dynamics for maintaining a healthy information exchange environment is identified. Originality/value: This study extends the PRE framework of privacy to include corporate privacy responsibility, privacy empowerment and trust. This is one of the first studies to explore both antecedents and outcomes of privacy empowerment.

Based on the panel data of 286 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 1999-2019, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is conducted on the relationship between new urbanization quality and foreign direct investment (FDI) location choice. The results show that (1) the new urbanization quality has a negative impact on FDI inflows; (2) the impact of new urbanization quality on FDI inflows differs among cities of different nature, with the negative impact of the Pearl River Delta city cluster being larger than that of the Yangtze River Delta city cluster and larger than that of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei city cluster; the negative impact of eastern cities being larger than that of central and western regions; the negative impact of sub-provincial cities being larger than that of cities above the provincial level; and the negative impact of non-coastal cities being larger than that of coastal cities. The article argues that the Chinese government should improve the construction of new urbanization quality, so as to drive the control effect on polluting FDI, encourage the introduction of technology-based FDI and restrict the inflow of polluting FDI, while strengthening the coordinated development of regions and improving the ability of attracting foreign investment in regions with relatively weak economic foundation, so as to mitigate the negative impact of new urbanization process on FDI inflow.","Environmental Pollution; Fdi; Location Choice; New Urbanization Quality Quality; Panel Data; Digital Storage; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Investments; Quality Control; River Pollution; Social Aspects; Coastal Cities; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Pollutions; Foreign Direct Investments; Location Choice; New Urbanization Quality Quality; Panel Data; Pearl River Delta; Qualitative And Quantitative Analysis; Yangtze River Delta; Location","Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Economics; Investments; Quality control; River pollution; Social aspects; Coastal cities; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental pollutions; Foreign direct investments; Location choice; New urbanization quality quality; Panel data; Pearl River delta; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Yangtze river delta; Location","","Journal of Southwestern University Social Science Edition, (2010); Geographical Research, (2011); Southern Economy, (2010); Macroeconomic Research, (2020); Journal of Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, (2014); Science and Technology Progress and Countermeasures, (2021); East China Economic Management, (2021); World Economic Research, (2010); Management World, (2006); Ecological Economics, (2020)","Patnaik, S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665407670","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143130133"

The value associated with such implementation projects is very closely linked with the efficient use of the project management approach and a robust strategy to handle the technological challenges. This paper puts light on such initiatives implemented in a giant gas field. In this giant gas condensate field, a vast amount of data is generated and monitored on a daily basis. The frequent need to deliver the dynamic production target was driving this project implementation so that a value-driven system can be established while achieving the business KPIs. A phased approach was used to target multiple requirements into business deliverables where the early offline phases provided a robust base for full online integration. This project followed the agile approach focusing on getting insights from multiple stakeholders and domain experts and developing a lesson-learnt repository in all the project phases. The online integration solution is a critical differentiator in the workforce and process efficiency improvement. The multiple technical solution workflows helped in reducing manual efforts and streamlining the methodology in a standardized fashion. In addition, the standard project management practices, such as initializing the phases in a planned manner, followed by an interactive execution, monitoring, and controlling stages, ensured delivering project outcomes in an efficient way. This implementation also established a robust collaborative team effort to identify various different roles and responsibilities for stakeholders. This helped in the end phase when the project sustainability was essential. A strong team base maintained and updated the integrated system while delivering daily well and facility surveillance objectives and KPIs from users ranging from planning, engineering, operation, and management team. A special focus on IT team involvement throughout the project phase led to a successful data integration and diagnostic, as the core of the solution was a data-driven analytical framework integrated with multiple corporate and real-time data sources. In addition, this solution was equipped with various one-of-its-kind solution features such as business intelligence, advanced surveillance, dynamic-reservoir integration, manage-by-exception workflows, intelligence alerts, along with a strong digital framework and data architecture. The unique hybrid and agile project management approach focusing on delivering emerging trends and technologies to end-users in the most efficient way paved the way for achieving asset digitalization and standardization goals.","Big Data; Digital Storage; Gas Condensates; Gas Industry; Human Resource Management; Information Management; Project Management; Reservoir Management; Digitisation; Emerging Trends; Giant Gas Fields; Implementation Projects; Integrated Asset Modeling; Model Application; Oil And Gas Industry; Online Integration; Project Phasis; Work-flows; Data Integration","Big data; Digital storage; Gas condensates; Gas industry; Human resource management; Information management; Project management; Reservoir management; Digitisation; Emerging trends; Giant gas fields; Implementation projects; Integrated Asset Modeling; Model application; Oil and Gas Industry; Online integration; Project phasis; Work-flows; Data integration","","Next Generation Data Driven Analytics Leveraging Diagnostic Analytics in Model Based Production Workflows Nagaraju Reddicharla; A Holistic Outlook on Integrated Data Management and Architecture Philosophy in Digital Oil Field Production Workflows Lessons Learned from 2006 2019 in Giant Brown Fields; Data and Model Integration Challenges for Integrated Production Forecasting Experience from Super Giant Onshore Fields Nagaraju Reddicharla","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","9781613998342","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127642368"

However, the big data age has brought new challenges against the legacy business management model, especially in performance management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Performance management as a key component of intra-company management calls for the need of collecting more unbiased data in relation to performance management, establishing a better performance feedback mechanism, and training more multidisciplinary talents in the field of performance management. CSR management is challenged by the request for enhancing data integration capabilities, intensifying the transparent management of CSR data and laying down a plurality of CSR information processing mechanisms. To improve the deliverables of in-house performance management, company is advised to use big data technology for improving the capabilities of performance data analysis, constructing the big data-based performance feedback mechanism, and building a team with multidisciplinary members who are capable of using big data technology for performance management; to form a new CSR management system, company is advised to boost the CSR reform that is driven by internal drive, collaboratively establish a reciprocal CSR operation mechanism, and develop a sort of CSR management model that enables crossover integration. In the big data age, company is advised to proactively use big data technology to reform or develop an innovative business management model, which can in turn enhance its capabilities of business management.","Big Data; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Management Model; Performance Management; Data Integration; Digital Storage; Feedback Control; Human Resource Management; Information Management; Social Aspects; Broad Application; Business Management; Corporate Social Responsibility; Data Technologies; Feedback Mechanisms; Management Model; Modern Time; Performance Feedback; Performance Management; Big Data","Data integration; Digital storage; Feedback control; Human resource management; Information management; Social aspects; Broad application; Business management; Corporate social responsibility; Data technologies; Feedback mechanisms; Management Model; Modern time; Performance feedback; Performance management; Big data","","Big Data Seizing Opportunities Executive Office of the President Preserving Values, (2014); Mcafee, Andrew P., Big data: The management revolution, Harvard Business Review, 90, 10, (2012); Strategic Human Resource Management, (2014); Orning, (1992); Journal of Intelligence, (2010); Economic Observer, (2018); Management Tasks Responsibilities Practices Tasks, (2009); Chinese Journal of Management in Chinese, (2014); Tianjin Social Sciences in Chinese, (2015); Business Management Journal, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665494892","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126968339"

Resulting social phenomena arise that have not been considered in the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Therefore, this scientific contribution provides a solution proposal for the further development of the CSR concept into the Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) concept, taking into account economic, ecological and social aspects of sustainability both in the physical and digital living environment. Building on this, the scenario technique of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection is transferred into the university context to offer an example on how universities can responsibly design their future digitalization strategy. While the findings show that the scenario technique can be applied to contexts other than companies, they also show that for the successful transfer of CDR into university practice, a close exchange between universities and the state with regard to a clear allocation of responsibilities must take place.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Scenario Technique; Sustainability","","","Arntz, Melanie, Digitisation and the Future of Work, Wirtschaftsdienst, 100, pp. 41-47, (2020); Iese Insight, (2015); Cambridge Service Alliance, (2015); undefined; Szenarientechnik Der Cdr Initiative Die Methode Erklart, (2019); undefined; Cdr Initiative Eine Gemeinsame Plattform, (2019); undefined; Praxisleitfaden Corporate Digital Responsibility Unternehmerische Verantwortung Und Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement Im Digitalzeitalter, (2020); Neue Formen Der Koproduktion Von Wissen Durch Lehrende Und Lernende Arbeitspapier 24 Des Hochschulforums Digitalisierung, (2016)","Herberger, T.A.; Dötsch, J.J.","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","21987254; 21987246","9783031900532; 9783319338637; 9783031766572; 9783030552763; 9783030305482; 9783031065804; 9783031261206; 9783030506759; 9789811678172; 9783031290190","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125299227"

This is why this article focuses on the development of the motivation system aimed at the more active transition to renewable sources consumption in the balanced combination alongside the traditional sources. The research question is whether digital public goods (DPG) may be a mean to support “Affordable and Clean Energy’’ use. The theoretical approach to our research problem is stakeholder’s theory, while the concept applied to the motivation mechanism implementation is the United Nations Organization’s concept of sustainable development goals (SDG). The research design is as follows: study of the actual data of energy structure of the world economy; identification of the current instruments of renewable energy distribution; analysis of the DPG as a perspective form of the sustainable energy behavior introduced [AO1] in the digitalized environment; definition of the energy industry stakeholders; development of the architecture of energy consumption by DPG application to reach SDG “Affordable and Clean Energy”. The main findings of the study are that DPG has been found to be a relevant means for the motivation and support of sustainable energy behavior through the architecture of energy consumption, based on research and development, customer relationship management, corporate social responsibility – sustainable development, technical implementation, and the diversity of traditional and alternative sources of energy.","Digital Public Goods; Energy; Sustainable Development Goal; System; Value","","","Boosting Virtual Reality Learning within Higher Business Management Education; Chan, Nathan W., A generalized impure public good and linear characteristics model of green consumption, Resource and Energy Economics, 37, pp. 1-16, (2014); Digital Public Goods Definition Official Web Site Digital Public Goods Alliance; Abele, Eberhard, Learning factories for research, education, and training, Procedia CIRP, 32, pp. 1-6, (2015); Journal of Science Informed Design, (2021); Greenstein, Shane M., Digital public goods, IEEE Micro, 33, 5, pp. 62-63, (2013); Global Governance Spotlight, (2019); Boosting the Role of Heis in the Industrial Transformation Towards the Industry 4 0 Paradigm in Georgia and Ukraine, (2021); Hulshof, Daan, The impact of renewable energy use on firm profit, Energy Economics, 92, (2020); Energy Economics Economic Dynamics of Global Energy Geopolitics, (2019)","","Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences","14296675","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123315906"

Originality/value: In this regard, it was found that there is not enough theoretical and legal foundation that allows different types of organizations to face the implications of the adoption of new technologies. Therefore, essential foundations and considerations are raised for the development of corporate digital responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: The document presents a hermeneutical investigation based on a systemic literature review within the framework of two investigations. The first addressed the relevance of creating a new subject for traditional social responsibility in digital contexts, and the second demonstrated the epistemological need for social responsibility in technologies. Findings: Firstly, the fact that new technologies pose a social risk makes them a subject of social responsibility study. Secondly, the absence of regulations on industry 4.0 and the unpredictability of the advancement of technologies is not a limitation for creating a scenario of corporate digital responsibility. To conclude, the development of social responsibility in digital contexts is possible and necessary. However, we must be attentive to the variables of social risk that may arise with each new technology. Therefore, a constant review of the foundations and bases of corporate digital responsibility is needed.","Artificial Intelligence; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Industries 4.0; Social Risk","","","Jurnal Sistem Cerdas, (2019); Responsabilidad Social Corporativa En La Era Digital De La Informacion A La Comunicacion Cuadernos De La Catedra La Caixa Cuaderno N 25, (2014); Anderson, Susan Leigh, A prima facie duty approach to machine ethics: Machine learning of features of ethical dilemmas, prima facie duties, and decision principles through a dialogue with ethicists, 9780521112352, pp. 476-492, (2011); Perfiles Latinoamericanos, (2002); Yo Robot 9a Reimp, (2017); Aßländer, Michael S., Corporate social responsibility as subsidiary co-responsibility: A macroeconomic perspective, Journal of Business Ethics, 99, 1, pp. 115-128, (2011); Revista Puce, (2017); Barbosa, Natã Miccael, Rehumanized crowdsourcing: A labeling framework addressing bias and ethics in machine learning, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2019); La Sociedad Del Riesgo Global, (2002); Metodologia De La Investigacion, (2010)","","Mackenzie Presbyterian University","16786971; 15186776","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122386626"

Product recalls can assist in removing potentially unsafe products from the marketplace and minimizing a company's responsibility for corporate negligence. Today's systems and technologies leveraged for product recall management in the automotive supply chain fall short in providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach to overcome the aforementioned problems related to product recall management. We employ the public Ethereum blockchain and integrate it with the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to deal with the large-sized data problem. We present the system design and six algorithms explaining the working principles, information exchange flow, and stakeholders' detail and their sequential interactions. We discuss the implementation details, generalization aspects, and cost and security analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed solution is cost-effective, secure, and enables automakers to have end-to-end visibility of information during product recalls. We make the smart contracts' code publicly available on GitHub.","Automotive Industry; Automotive Supply Chain; Blockchain; Ethereum; Product Recall Management; Smart Contract; Traceability; Automobiles; Automotive Industry; Blockchain; Cost Benefit Analysis; Cost Effectiveness; Digital Storage; Ethereum; Supply Chains; Automotive Supply Chains; Block-chain; Corporates; Human Lives; Product Recall Management; Products Recalls; Safe Operation; Stakeholder; Traceability; Smart Contract","Automobiles; Automotive industry; Blockchain; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Ethereum; Supply chains; Automotive supply chains; Block-chain; Corporates; Human lives; Product recall management; Products recalls; Safe operation; Stakeholder; Traceability; Smart contract","","Contribution of the Automotive Industry to the Economies of all Fifty States and the United States Center for Automotive Research, (2020); Moving Parts how the Automotive Industry is Transforming Supply Chain Dive, (2018); Chandra, Charu, Knowledge management for consumer-focused product design, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 14, 6, pp. 557-580, (2003); Destech Trans Environ Energy Earth Sci, (2016); Operations and Supply Chain Management, (2014); Int J Bus Sci Appl Manage; Return to Sender Resolving the Automotive Recall Resurgence, (2019); Chi, Chia-Fen, Classification Scheme for Root Cause and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of Passenger Vehicle Recalls, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 200, (2020); International Journal of Managing Value and Supply Chains, (2013); Ford Cruise Control Deactivation Switch Recalls and His Tory, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122095790"

Strict closure measures not only pose great challenges to the economy of China and even the world, but also pose new challenges to the operation of construction enterprises. The break of COVID-19 by the end of 2019 has a strong impact on the operation of construction enterprises. Facing the great changes of environment, construction enterprises need to actively respond to social problems. This paper proposes that construction enterprises reconstruct their corporate social responsibility (CRS) based on digital empowerment to motivate them to undertake social responsibility initiatively under the background of normalization of prevention and control of COVID-19. It also puts forward the path of CRS reconstruction from the perspective of strategy reconstruction, mechanism reconstruction, structure reconstruction, and capability reconstruction by the digital transformation of construction enterprises. The conclusion of the research provides reference for them to realize double benefits in business and society value creation, which will promote sustainable development of the construction enterprises and the society. At the same time, in the era of digital economy, digitalization can promote the reconstruction of social responsibility of construction enterprises, to adapt to the competition of enterprises under the new normal background of epidemic prevention and promote the healthy and sustainable development of enterprises.","Competition; Disaster Prevention; Multimodal Transportation; Planning; Sustainable Development; Change Of Environment; Construction Enterprise; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Environment Constructions; Normalisation; Prevention And Controls; Social Problems; Social Responsibilities; Structure Reconstruction; Covid-19","Competition; Disaster prevention; Multimodal transportation; Planning; Sustainable development; Change of environment; Construction enterprise; Corporate social responsibility; Digital transformation; Environment constructions; Normalisation; Prevention and controls; Social problems; Social responsibilities; Structure reconstruction; COVID-19","","What does China S Gdp has Exceeded One Million Trillion Yuan for the First Time Mean, (2021); Journal of Macro Quality Research, (2020); Enterprise Internal Control, (2020); Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, (2018); Jilin Tonghua Designated Central Isolation Project is Under Construction, (2021); Southern Weekly, (2020); Record of the Construction of Leishenshan and Huoshenshan Hospital, (2020); Engineering Economy, (2019)","Wang, Y.; Zhang, D.; Shen, G.Q.P.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","9780784483848","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121606315"

We argue that brands–limited to the German market–utilise COVID-19 in manifold ways, involving themselves in social causes and, furthermore, in many cases, assuming a role as a spokesperson for crisis communication.

We argue, metaphorically, that the response to SARS-CoV-2 contains 'genetic' material from HIV, which has (as a result of the digital age which reproduces error-filled data at incredible speed) mutated and is being transmitted into the social and political body. Using sexual health and substance use as focal points, we turn to Deleuzoguattarian theoretical insights about the assemblage of desire, affect and material factors that produce epidemics. Contrasting historical and contemporary scenes and issues, we explore the complex assemblage created by viral loads, medical and public health protocols, conceptions of risk, responsibility and fear that connect both pandemics. Finally, we consider the goal of viral eradication and related militaristic metaphors, alongside the increasing convergence of medicine, public health, the law and corporate interests, and contrast this with community responses that engage with what it means to be living and dying in viral times.","Aids; Covid-19; Hiv; New Materialism; Pandemic; Viral; Human; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Pandemic; Public Health; Covid-19; Hiv Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; Sars-cov-2","human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; pandemic; public health; COVID-19; HIV Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2","Adrian Guta is supported by a University of Windsor Humanities Research Group Fellowship, and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding.

To pave the way for sustainable development and meet growing societal needs, an integrated approach that integrates social, environmental, industry and societal interests must be used, particularly with regard to a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment (VUCA). Creative and Culture Industries (CCIs) by their nature are digitally oriented. All CCIs include both physical and digital products and services. The vast majority of all growth generated by CCIs today is digital - the non-digital portion of the business is generally stagnant or even shrinking (However, research on to what extent and how digitization has positive and/or negative effects on economic, social, environmental and cultural outcomes is still premature. World Economic Forum, under the combination of desired economic efficiency, social justice, environmental responsibility, and institutional stability, CCIs and digitization become key enablers of sustainable ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to explore how CCIs as primary drivers can influence the of sustainable social progress and meet opposing growing societal needs. Using a research niche, the authors of this paper conducted a study between September and December 2020, selecting entities in the research pool that have worked with CCIs to deliver innovative product, service, business model, or process solutions in the past two years. The research objective was to investigate the process of cooperation between the traditional and creative sectors in five areas of Social, Process, Financial, Corporate and Socio-Environment Level. Due to the lack of methodological tools to study such a process, the following article presents the results of the question selection and correctly constructed scales.","Cross Innovation; Cross Innovation Process; Cultural And Creative Industry; Sustainable Development; Economic And Social Effects; Ecosystems; Industrial Economics; Life Cycle; Planning; Creatives; Cross Innovation; Cross Innovation Process; Cultural And Creative Industries; Digital Services; Digitisation; Environmental Industries; Innovations Process; Integrated Approach; Physical Products; Sustainable Development","Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Industrial economics; Life cycle; Planning; Creatives; Cross innovation; Cross innovation process; Cultural and creative industries; Digital services; Digitisation; Environmental industries; Innovations process; Integrated approach; Physical products; Sustainable development","","Ioppolo, Giuseppe, Sustainable local development and environmental governance: A strategic planning experience, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 2, (2016); New Urban Crisis, (2017); Klein, Monika, Creative and culture industry in baltic sea region condition and future, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 8, (2021); Brainstorming Report Voices of Culture Structured Dialogue Between the European Commission and the Cultural Sector, (2021); Cooke, Philip N., Creative regions: Technology, culture and knowledge entrepreneurship, pp. 1-294, (2007); Regiony Kreatywnej Wiedzy Zarys Miedzynarodowego Projektu Badawczego Acre, (2008); Klein, Monika, Cross-sector partnerships for innovation and growth: Can creative industries support traditional sector innovations?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 23, pp. 1-19, (2020); Quadruple Innovation Helix Nexus, (2017); Hidden Innovation in the Creative Industries, (2008); An Introduction to the Definition and Measurement of Soft Innovation, (2007)","Watrobski, J.; Salabun, W.; Toro, C.; Zanni-Merk, C.; Howlett, R.J.; Jain, L.C.; Jain, L.C.","Elsevier B.V.","18770509","9781510849914","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116892865"

To answer this question, this research looks at the microfoundations of the diffusion of a socially responsible practice. This approach enables us to adopt a perspective that is focused on individuals and to explain the integration of CSR practices at the organizational level. We mobilize neo-institutional theory (NIT) and actor-network theory (ANT) in our approach to the diffusion process of this innovative practice. First, we identify three distinct stages in institutional practice: the pre-institutionalization stage, the theorization stage, and the reinstitutionalization stage. Second, we reveal the four stages of the diffusion of a CSR practice as identified by the ANT: the designation of an actor initiating the change, the identification of allies for the deployment of innovation, the analysis of the diffusion process within the network, and the conditions of diffusion. Finally, we produce six research propositions based on the results of our study, which advocate for multileveled analysis to understand how CSR practices are developed within organizations.","Actor-network Theory; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Sector; Microfoundations; Neo-institutional Theory","","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers, Vincent Mangematin and Thomas Roulet, for their helpful comments and valuable suggestions.

In the digital era, markets have increasingly become more competitive. CSR is perceived as a bunch of practical measures and working modalities that are voluntarily pursued and adopted by businesses, as well as individuals, when social and environmental issues are concordantly incorporated in those set of policies and procedures, alongside the pursuit of profits. When businesses try to seamlessly merge their economic interests with their societal and environmental obligations, the association with all the stakeholders is founded on the ethical values of respect towards the society and environment in general, and individuals in particular.

The purpose of this paper is to present and provide basic testing of an original model of responsible behaviour. The model is inspired by the theory of planned behaviour distinguishing between consciousness, intentions, and behaviour. The presented model applies these to individual as well as to social and environmental responsibility while taking into account the social, technological, and natural environments. The research is based on the presumption that it is crucial to connect the individual dimension of responsibility with the environmental and social dimensions to achieve environmental and social sustainability at the micro-level. Data for the preliminary testing of the model was collected from an online social survey among Slovenian youth and analysed through partial correlations and path analysis. The results show that individual responsibility is strongly connected to social and environmental responsibilities, but only in terms of behaviour, and not values and intentions. Responsibility is also strongly connected to the social and technological environment, especially to the ways how young people are using digital technology.","Planned Behaviour; Responsibility; Slovenia; Sustainable Development; Technology; Youth; Corporate Social Responsibility; Correlation; Individualism; Numerical Model; Trend Analysis; World Wide Web; Young Population; Slovenia","corporate social responsibility; correlation; individualism; numerical model; trend analysis; World Wide Web; young population; Slovenia","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Javna agencija za raziskovalno dejavnost Republike Slovenije (Slovenian Research Agency), grant number J5-788.

In the past 40 years, the unprecedented development of digital information and communication technologies, globalization and the increasing power of large corporations have disrupted value scales that were believed to be solidly entrenched. The way we create, store, access and assess information and knowledge; the world of work and knowledge; the competences and skills needed to access and remain in the university; and the ways we research and the very meaning of research have all been transformed. And the question is: What role does the university play today? Because the issues related to the ways academic responsibility and quality are assessed, the mechanisms of hiring and promoting teaching and research staff, support for innovation and scientific advancement and the role of scholarly publications in academic promotion may have very different answers depending on the institution’s mission, vision and ambition. In this text, I examine the four challenges of today’s university which I consider the most important, related to ‘excessive’ numbers of students, the exponential growth in information, the influence of business management and the bureaucratization of university work.","Bureaucratization Of The University; Challenges For Universities; Corporate Universities; Digital Society","","","El Confidencial, (2020); El Pais, (2020); Do University Excellence Initiatives Work, (2020); undefined, (2007); Diane Ravitchs Blog, (2020); Berliner, David C., Comment: Educational Research:The Hardest Science of All, Educational Researcher, 31, 8, pp. 18-20, (2002); Côté, James E., Ivory tower blues: A university system in crisis, pp. 1-251, (2007); Introduccion A La Mediologia, (2001); La Universidad En El Siglo Xxi Para Una Reforma Democratica Y Emancipadora De La Universidad, (2005); Para Una Transformacion De La Universidad Nuevas Relaciones Entre Investigacion Saber Y Docencia, (2008)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","15784118; 11356405","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106231686"

Technology, especially digital technology, has changed the way of doing business around the globe. Marketers need to develop new strategies by incorporating the element of digital technology to overrun their competitors, as conventional competitive strategies will not produce extraordinaryresults. The rise of social media, in this regard, is a game-changer in the context of marketing as it provides a strategic touchpoint to the marketers to involve the customers with a brand. Prior research has largely ignored the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of a brand and positive customer experiences. Hence the present study aims to test the relationship of customer-related CSR activities on social media on behavioral consequences of customers, such as their purchase likelihood and electronic word of mouth (E-WOM). The data were collected from the banking customers of a developing economy and were analyzed through structural equation modeling in AMOS software. The results revealed that customer-related CSR activitieson social mediainfluence customer behavioral outcomes like E-WOM and purchase intentions. The result also revealed that brand attitude mediates the relationship between customer-related CSR, E-WOM, and purchase intentions. The findings of the present study can help policymakers to understand the importance of CSRpractices from the perspective of marketing, which is largely ignored by contemporary CSR researchers.","Brand Attitude; Csr Communication; E-word Of Mouth; Social Media Strategy; Sustainability","","","Wang, Ruoxu, Communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) on social media: How do message source and types of CSR messages influence stakeholders’ perceptions?, Corporate Communications, 23, 3, pp. 326-341, (2018); van Doorn, Jenny, The impact of corporate social responsibility on customer attitudes and retention—the moderating role of brand success indicators, Marketing Letters, 28, 4, pp. 607-619, (2017); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate social responsibility: Evolution of a definitional construct, Business and Society, 38, 3, pp. 268-295, (1999); Fatma, Mobin, CSR and consumer behavioral responses: the role of customer-company identification, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 30, 2, pp. 460-477, (2018); Latif, Khawaja Fawad, Revisiting the relationship between corporate social responsibility and organizational performance: The mediating role of team outcomes, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 4, pp. 1630-1641, (2020); González-Rodríguez, María Rosario, Hotels’ corporate social responsibility practices, organizational culture, firm reputation, and performance, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 27, 3, pp. 398-419, (2019); Goyal, Praveen, A Bayesian Network Model on the association between CSR, perceived service quality and customer loyalty in Indian Banking Industry, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 10, pp. 50-65, (2017); Moliner, Miguel Ángel, CSR marketing outcomes and branch managers’ perceptions of CSR, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 38, 1, pp. 63-85, (2020); Chomvilailuk, Rojanasak, The impact of strategic CSR marketing communications on customer engagement, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 36, 7, pp. 764-777, (2018); Mellahi, Kamel, CSR in the Middle East: From Philanthropy to Modern CSR, pp. 39-51, (2019)","","MDPI AG","07181876","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103841201"

Keeping in the spirit of societal impact during this time, we probe the transformative potential of data in fighting global pandemics. This paper examines data philanthropy and its impact on global health outcomes when mediated through digital epidemiology. Data philanthropy is the sharing and collaboration of private data resources with external institutions while digital epidemiology is the study of epidemics that employs big data methods and nontraditional data sources for medical research. We find that data philanthropy positively impacts global health when mediated through digital epidemiology. Employing positivist qualitative case research methods, we study the linkages between health, data, and corporate social responsibility.","Data Collaboratives; Data Philanthropy; Digital Epidemiology; Digital Health; Pandemics; Blending; Information Systems; Information Use; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Data-sources; Global Health; Medical Research; Private Data; Societal Impacts; Epidemiology","Blending; Information systems; Information use; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data-sources; Global health; Medical research; Private data; Societal impacts; Epidemiology","","Development Data Partnership, (2020); Barzilay, Ohad, Understanding reuse of software examples: A case study of prejudice in a community of practice, Information and Software Technology, 56, 12, pp. 1613-1628, (2014); Stat, (2020); Weekly Releases 19972007, (2007); Brownstein, John S., Digital disease detection - Harnessing the web for public health surveillance, New England Journal of Medicine, 360, 21, pp. 2153-2157, (2009); Chell, Elizabeth, A study of entrepreneurship in the restaurant and café industry: Exploratory work using the critical incident technique as a methodology: Prize-winning Paper from the IAHMS Conference at Sheffield Hallam University, England, November 1997, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 17, 1, pp. 23-32, (1998); Conversation, (2020); Dubé, Line, Rigor in information systems positivist case research: Current practices, trends, and recommendations, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 27, 4, pp. 597-635, (2003); Eysenbach, Gunther, Infodemiology: tracking flu-related searches on the web for syndromic surveillance., AMIA Annual Symposium proceedings, pp. 244-248, (2006); Facebook Data for Good, (2020)","","Association for Information Systems","","9781733632553","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103444660"

Social Medias offer consumers and brands multiple opportunities of interactions. Consumers, who become more active in the communication process, do not hesitate to express themselves about brands and companies. This situation pushes companies to reinvent their relationship with the clients and adapt their offers to fulfill their needs. Furthermore, Dawkins (2004) suggested that an effective CSR communication plan is the one that depends on a clear strategy that assesses the risks taken by the brand, and delivers precise messages to the various stakeholders. However, the impact of CSR communication should not be overestimated. Hence the choice of our following problematic: ""What is the impact of CSR communication on the reputation of the company?"" This paper addresses a review of two pillars; CSR communication and corporate reputation with focus on e-reputation. The interception between these two paradigms will clarify the combining concept of CSR and Reputation. Findings of this review reveal that the CSR affects reputation, the more committed is the company on sustainable development, the more it wins a good reputation, and finally, the impact of a lack of commitment on the company's reputation is bigger than the communication on CSR initiatives.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr Initiatives; E-reputation; Reputation, Csr Communication; Sustainable Development","","","Dawkins, Jenny, Corporate responsibility: The communication challenge, Journal of Communication Management, 9, 2, pp. 108-119, (2005); Social and Environmental Responsibility of the Company, (2005); Capitalism and Freedom, (1962); Marketing and Management of Innovations, (2020); Sloan Management Review, (2000); Jones, Thomas M., Convergent stakeholder theory, Academy of Management Review, 24, 2, pp. 206-221, (1999); Salmon, Anne, Corporates Welfare.

This paper aims to highlight the impacts and the connections between five drivers of the success of food sharing platforms and their role in favoring consumer behavioral responses. Using multiple regression and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, the study analyzed data from 455 OLIO users. The results reveal the fundamental and interconnected roles of consumer familiarity, perception of environmental and social responsibility, and community social support, in enhancing consumer behavioral response. The research contributes to the literature and provides insights for managers by highlighting how corporate social responsibility (CSR), in combination with social support, strengthens the success of food sharing.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Transformation; Food Sharing; Food Waste; Sharing Economy; Social Support","","","Abrate, Graziano, Personal or Product Reputation?

The findings demonstrated that the solution-oriented story elicited more positive affect, issue interest, self-efficacy, intentions of sharing the story on social media or researching the issue, favourable attitudes towards the advertisement and the brand, purchase intention, and recommendation intention. Irrelevant advertising elicited significantly less favourable attitudes towards the advertisement and the brand, purchase intention, and recommendation intention.

Such tensions are contradictory, persistent and interrelated, suggesting paradoxes. Yet, we lack insight into how such apparent paradoxes are constructed and to what effect. This empirical paper draws upon interviews with thirty-nine responsibility managers to unpack how paradoxes are discursively (re)constructed and resolved as a rhetoric of ‘balance’ that ensures identification with organizational, familial and societal interests. We also reveal how such ‘false balance’ sustains and legitimizes organizational activity by displacing responsibilities onto distant ‘others’ through temporal (futurizing), spatial (externalizing) and level (magnifying / individualizing) rhetorical devices. In revealing the process of paradox construction and resolution as ‘balance’ in the context of digitalization and its unanticipated outcomes, we join conversations into new organizational responsibilities in the digital economy, with implications for theory and practice.","Balance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Paradox; Rhetoric","","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge the very helpful assistance provided by Niloofar Borghei Razavi, PhD student at Henley Business School, who conducted half of the interviews.

Looking at four principal stakeholders, we propose corporate digital responsibility (CDR) as a novel concept. We define CDR as the set of shared values and norms guiding an organization's operations with respect to four main processes related to digital technology and data. These processes are the creation of technology and data capture, operation and decision making, inspection and impact assessment, and refinement of technology and data. We expand our discussion by highlighting how to managerially effectuate CDR compliant behavior based on an organizational culture perspective. Our conceptualization unlocks future research opportunities, especially regarding pertinent antecedents and consequences. Managerially, we shed first light on how an organization's shared values and norms regarding CDR can get translated into actionable guidelines for users. This provides grounds for future discussions related to CDR readiness, implementation, and success.","Corporate Digital Responsibility (cdr); Data; Digital Technologies; Ethics; Organizational Culture; Privacy","","","Acquisti, Alessandro, Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, Science, 347, 6221, pp. 509-514, (2015); Acquisti, Alessandro, Is there a cost to privacy breaches?

This competence has to be introduced in students’ training in business degree programs, and a check must then be done to determine if the students have come to appreciate the importance of CSR commitments. Using the framework of Stakeholders Theory, this work aims to examine students’ perceptions of ethical and CSR practices and commitment to different stakeholders, as well as the factors that lead students to act in a socially responsible way. Furthermore, we hope to identify how the perception of CSR can be improved when Web 2.0 and social media tools that have proven effective in transmitting emotions and values are used in classrooms to teach these ideas. To this end, a survey was carried out in the year 2019 with 1,030 first-year students; it was administered at the beginning of the semester and also at the end of the semester after the training activities had been carried out. The main finding of the research is that students start with the belief that ethics and CSR are developed for reasons of image and legitimacy; however, after receiving training on these topics through tools that take into account emotions and values, they start to value the importance of the company as an agent of social change. The main practical and managerial implication is that methods based on Web 2.0 and social media tools are useful to teach ethics and CSR; the theoretical contribution is that students take into account the welfare of others. This finding contributes to Stakeholder Theory in a higher education context.","Business Ethics; Corporative Social Responsibility; Digital Technologies; Higher Education; Social Media","","This research was funded by R&D Projects.

This article discusses texts recommending digital detox and how these accentuate dilemmas of what it means to be authentically human in the age of constant connectivity. Digital detox can be defined as a periodic disconnection from social or online media, or strategies to reduce digital media involvement. Digital detox stands in a long tradition of media resistance and resistance to new communication technologies, and non-use of media, but advocates balance and awareness more than permanent disconnection. Drawing on the analysis of 20 texts promoting digital detox: self-help literature, memoirs and corporate websites, the article discusses how problems with digital media are defined and recommended strategies to handle them. The analysis is structured around three dominant themes emerging in the material: descriptions of temporal overload and 24/7 connectivity, experiences of spatial intrusion and loss of contact with ‘real life’ and descriptions of damage to body and mind. A second research topic concerns how arguments for digital detox can be understood within a wider cultural and political context. Here, we argue that digital detox texts illuminate the rise of a self-regulation society, where individuals are expected to take personal responsibility for balancing risks and pressures, as well as representing a form of commodification of authenticity and nostalgia.","Authenticity; Constant Connectivity; Digital Detox; Digital Life; Digital Media; Disconnection; Media Resistance; Non-use; Responsibilization; Self-help; Social Media","","","3 Ways to Kick Off Digital Detox Week, (2015); Banet-Weiser, Sarah, Authentic™: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, pp. 1-265, (2012); Community in the Digital Age Philosophy and Practice, (2004); Consuming Life, (2007); Baumer, Eric P.S., Limiting, leaving, and (re)lapsing: An exploration of Facebook non-use practices and experiences, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 3257-3266, (2013); Personal Connections in the Digital Age, (2010); Illuminations Essays and Reflections, (1968); Politics of Authenticity Radical Individualism and the Emergence of Modern Society, (1970); Blair, Ann M., Reading Strategies for Coping with Information Overload ca. 1550-1700, Journal of the History of Ideas, 64, 1, pp. 11-28, (2003); Logg Av, (2015)","","SAGE Publications Ltd info@sagepub.co.uk","13548565; 17487382","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067685289"

New challenges arise in facing digital work, digital employees, and digital management, such that the connection between new technologies and HRM is now described as electronic HRM (e-HRM). Challenges and connection entail the possibility to review the notion of HRM itself, examining new research perspectives and lines of interpretation following a Critical Management Studies approach, thus developing a more contextualized view in conceiving HRM, a more expansive consideration of stakeholders, and a longer-term perspective in approaching the results of digital transformation and HRM outcomes. The article analyzes a specific organizational case, involving a multinational enterprise, and explores how the case study enhances the understanding of HRM as a social practice embedded in specific situated contexts. Such a conception enables the engagement of multiple rationalities, related to both internal and external stakeholders, overcoming a “mere antiperformance stance” and achieving forms of reconstructive reflexivity concerning the interconnection between the digital age, HRM, and the innovative generation of social value through an authentic corporate responsibility.","Corporate Responsibility; Digital Transformation; E-hrm; Hrm; Social Value","","","Doing Critical Management Research, (2000); Alvesson, Mats, Reflecting on reflexivity: Reflexive textual practices in organization and management theory, Journal of Management Studies, 45, 3, pp. 480-501, (2008); Alvesson, Mats, Unraveling HRM: Identity, ceremony, and control in a management consulting firm, Organization Science, 18, 4, pp. 711-723, (2007); Critical Management Studies, (1992); Making Sense of Management A Critical Introduction, (1996); Insider Outsider Team Research, (1996); Bennett, Sue J., The 'digital natives' debate: A critical review of the evidence, British Journal of Educational Technology, 39, 5, pp. 775-786, (2008); Bondarouk, Tanya V., Conceptualising the future of HRM and technology research, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 27, 21, pp. 2652-2671, (2016); International Journal of Human Resource Management, (2015); E do, (2018)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","16641078","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097276712"

This article uses the Internet of Things (IoT) as a backdrop to demonstrate the concerns associated with transformative technologies and offers five recommendations as to how firms can develop the strategies needed for digital transformation and become digitally conscious: (1) Start small and build on firsthand benefits; (2) team up and create competitive advantage from brand recognition; (3) engage in standardization efforts; (4) take responsibility for data ownership and ethics; and (5) own the change and ensure organization-wide commitment. As such, this article shows that digital transformation should be a top management priority and a defining trait of corporate business strategy, and that by becoming digitally conscious, firms may get a head start on their transformation journey.","Digital Consciousness; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Digitization; Internet Of Things","","This study was made possible through a grant from VINNOVA.","Baines, Tim S., Servitization of the manufacturing firm: Exploring the operations practices and technologies that deliver advanced services, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 34, 1, pp. 2-35, (2014); Balakrishna, Chitra, Enabling technologies for smart city services and applications, pp. 223-227, (2012); Sloan Management Review, (1993); Borgia, Eleonora, The internet of things vision: Key features, applications and open issues, Computer Communications, 54, pp. 1-31, (2014); Brody, Paul, The next digital gold rush: How the internet of things will create liquid, transparent markets, Strategy and Leadership, 43, 1, pp. 36-41, (2015); Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in A Time of Brilliant Technologies, (2014); Strategy Business, (2014); Academy of Management Review, (1989); Internet of Things, (2015); Grover, V., The implementation of business process reengineering, Journal of Management Information Systems, 12, 1, pp. 109-144, (1995)","","Elsevier Ltd","00076813","","BHORA","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089452752"

The subreddit,/r/TheRedPill, is one such community. This article explores whether hiding this offensive content through digital “quarantine” or removing the community altogether is more ethically justifiable. We draw on theorizing about the ethics of social media content moderation to develop a framework for ethical decision-making based on transparency, corporate social responsibility, and human dignity to guide decisions about content removal.

For scholars, they also want to know whether academic research can fully respond to the changes in technology, social environment, and business models. Based on the changes in technology and the external environment, this paper divides the development of strategic management into four stages, Besides, the method of bibliometrics is used to analyze the research emphases and theoretical development of each stage from literature published in the Strategic Management Journal (SMJ), visualizing the development of strategy theory in different social backgrounds and technology environments, and explores its relationship with innovation studies further: 1.Embryonic Stage (before 1980): scholars focus on the individual level, such as CEO's decision-making, management behaviors; 2.Initial Stage (1980-1995): scholar turns to focus on the organization level, and combining the theory of economics and sociology to explore the pattern of an enterprise's strategic management; 3.Development Stage (1996-2006): with the emergence of knowledge economy, technology, innovation and network externalities have become important issues in business. But, the knowledge changes the pattern of value creation has not been paid much attention by strategy scholars; 4.Transformation Stage (2007-2018): in addition to Internet technologies, the business model aiming at corporate social responsibility has also attracted much attention. During this stage, scholars not only reintegrated the development of strategic management but also established the theoretical basis of the field, which is more connected with innovation.","Key Contributions; Knowledge Mapping; Strategy Management; Systematic Review; Decision Theory; Economics; Industrial Management; Research And Development Management; Sociology; Strategic Planning; Business Management Process; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Digital Technologies; External Environments; Industrial Revolutions; Strategic Management; Technological Change; Theoretical Development; Decision Making","Decision theory; Economics; Industrial management; Research and development management; Sociology; Strategic planning; Business management process; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Digital technologies; External environments; Industrial revolutions; Strategic management; Technological change; Theoretical development; Decision making","","Concept of Corporate Strategy, (1971); Corporate Strategy, (1965); Strategy and Structure Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise, (1962); Problem of Social Cost, (1960); Strategy Formulation Analytical Concepts, (1978); Selected Findings from the Pims Program, (1977); Knowledge Creating Company, (1995); Knowledge Based Economy, (1996); Competitive Advantage Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, (1980); Competitive Advantage, (1985)","Pretorius, L.; Pretorius, M.W.","University of Pretoria","","9781775921950","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092674730"

An individual’s ability to keep the pulse on the external world, have the courage to focus on the right things and ultimately generate measurable impact defines their success in this world and illustrates the communicator of the future. To guide the development of these communicators, AbbVie’s Corporate Responsibility, Brand & Communications (CRBC) competency framework includes specific skills rooted in a simple three-pronged model: know the context, prioritise and align and drive impact.

This study employs the power–responsibility equilibrium theory to explore emerging online privacy issues in the data-driven marketplace. This exploratory study, based on semi-structured interviews, explains why online shopping consumers are increasingly worried about their privacy and why they behave in a manner that could be detrimental to the consumer–vendor relationship. The findings suggest that deficiencies of corporate privacy responsibility and regulatory protection have deprived consumers of privacy empowerment. These deficiencies have also accentuated perceived privacy contract violations to trigger privacy concerns and subsequent defensive responses. We identify enhancement of consumer privacy empowerment and assuagement of privacy contract violations as two separate mechanisms of addressing online privacy issues. We also highlight the importance of addressing power and responsibility dynamics for maintaining a healthy information-exchange environment.","Contract Violations; Corporate Privacy Responsibility; Online Privacy Concerns; Power–responsibility Equilibrium; Privacy Empowerment","","","Amichai-Hamburger, Yair, E-empowerment: Empowerment by the Internet, Computers in Human Behavior, 24, 5, pp. 1776-1789, (2008); Awad, Neveen Farag, The personalization privacy paradox: An empirical evaluation of information transparency and the willingness to be profiled online for personalization, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 1, pp. 13-28, (2006); Bandara, Ruwan J., The Privacy Paradox in the Data-Driven Marketplace: The Role of Knowledge Deficiency and Psychological Distance, Procedia Computer Science, 121, pp. 562-567, (2017); Bandara, Ruwan J., Privacy concerns in E-commerce: A taxonomy and a future research agenda, Electronic Markets, 30, 3, pp. 629-647, (2020); Brandimarte, Laura, Misplaced Confidences: Privacy and the Control Paradox, Social Psychological and Personality Science, 4, 3, pp. 340-347, (2013); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Caudill, Eve M., Consumer online privacy: Legal and ethical issues, Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, 19, 1, pp. 7-19, (2000); Choi, Hanbyul, The role of privacy fatigue in online privacy behavior, Computers in Human Behavior, 81, pp. 42-51, (2018); Cohen, Sheldon A., Locus of control and the generality of learned helplessness in humans, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, 6, pp. 1049-1056, (1976); Colquitt, Jason A., Justice and personality: Using integrative theories to derive moderators of justice effects, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 100, 1, pp. 110-127, (2006)","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","14706423; 14706431","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081720363"

We explore this in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) context where online CSR dialogs form as brands interact with consumers using social media. Study 1 examines eight brands' digital CSR communications on Twitter and suggests these dialogs are present but are rarely part of the process with most interactions between their consumers. Study 2 assesses the brands' CSR relevant tweets' content and finds that most are not relevant to CSR and, moreover, are predominantly one-way. Therefore, both studies reveal that brands are not tapping into the potential for co-creation that is inherent in social media. Thus, we recommend that social media communications should include (a) mentions of individual consumers, (b) audience specific and relevant message content, and (c) opportunities for consumers to co-create value with the relevant brands.","Broadcast Media; Consumer Engagement; Corporate Social Responsibility; Online Csr Dialog; Social Media; Value Co-creation","","This research has been funded by the Research Innovation Fund (RIF 2016/17 ) of King's Business School at King's College London.","Adams, Amelia, Dialogue and transparency: A content analysis of how the 2012 presidential candidates used twitter, Public Relations Review, 39, 4, pp. 357-359, (2013); Ali, Raza, The moderating influences on the relationship of corporate reputation with its antecedents and consequences: A meta-analytic review, Journal of Business Research, 68, 5, pp. 1105-1117, (2015); Bhattacharya, C.

Due to the advancing digitalization of business sectors and increasing competitive pressures, industrial companies are forced to promote their own digital transformation to sustain on the market. Here, the literature regards the CFO as a key corporate function to induce digitization initiatives within organizations. The blockchain technology, due to its features of transparency, immutability and cryptography combined with its ability to coordinate data flows of e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) or Artificial Intelligence (AI), constitutes a suitable instrument for the CFO to meet the requirements of Industry 4.0. This paper provides a contribution to address existing research gaps regarding the application side of blockchain technology. Thus, the objective of this work is to provide corporate financial functions, such as the CFO of an industrial company, with an understanding of the extent to which blockchain technology can be used for the role-specific responsibilities. Therefore, the underlying qualitative study explores the influence of blockchain technology on the CFO-function of an industrial company. Thus, intending to address a research gap on the application side, it asks (1) What is the impact of blockchain technology on the financial as well strategic role of the CFO? (2) What is the impact of blockchain technology in convergence with the Machine Economy on the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the CFO? (3) What is the impact of blockchain-enabled integrated business ecosystems on the role of the CFO? Based on a review of literature, semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with 23 participants. Analysis of the responses demonstrated a considerable impact of blockchain technology on the CFO-function. The results indicate improvements of business processes in regard to efficiency and automation, a relocation of the CFO's strategic role, improvements of CFO-relevant KPIs through integrating machines into payment networks as well as the emergence of integrated business ecosystems facilitating new forms of inter-organizational collaboration. Necessary prerequisites for adoption include digital competences of the CFO, appropriate organizational structures, digital currencies and identities on the blockchain, a change of the competitive mindset as well as standardized platforms with a neutral governance.","Blockchain Technology; Business Ecosystems; Business Process Optimization; Cfo; Internet Of Things; Kpi; Machine Economy; Smart Contracts; Artificial Intelligence; Benchmarking; Blockchain; Economics; Ecosystems; Finance; Internet Of Things; Chief Financial Officers; Competitive Pressure; Digital Transformation; Industrial Companies; Internet Of Thing (iot); Interorganizational Collaboration; Key Performance Indicators; Organizational Structures; Economic And Social Effects","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Blockchain; Economics; Ecosystems; Finance; Internet of things; Chief financial officers; Competitive pressure; Digital transformation; Industrial companies; Internet of thing (IOT); Interorganizational collaboration; Key performance indicators; Organizational structures; Economic and social effects","","Convergence Ecosystem Convergence 2 0 Building the Decentralised Future, (2018); Realignment of the Chinese Economy and Its Global Implications, (2018); World Factbook, (2019); Digitale Transformation in Der Industrie, (2019); Risius, Marten, A Blockchain Research Framework: What We (don’t) Know, Where We Go from Here, and How We Will Get There, Business and Information Systems Engineering, 59, 6, pp. 385-409, (2017); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Andoni, Merlinda, Blockchain technology in the energy sector: A systematic review of challenges and opportunities, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 100, pp. 143-174, (2019); Christidis, Konstantinos, Blockchains and Smart Contracts for the Internet of Things, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 2292-2303, (2016); Makhdoom, Imran, Blockchain's adoption in IoT: The challenges, and a way forward, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 125, pp. 251-279, (2019); Zheng, Zibin, Blockchain challenges and opportunities: A survey, International Journal of Web and Grid Services, 14, 4, pp. 352-375, (2018)","","MDPI AG rasetti@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","19995903","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089537995"

The intersection of both processes compels us to harness the potential of new technological systems to transform how humanity manages its environmental footprint. However, our interaction with the environment is not the only interaction we have to change. New technologies can automatically monitor animal welfare. These management processes will increase stakeholder confidence and therefore the reputation of food companies. Since corporate governance is key for corporate sustainability, new monitoring processes should begin to be included in the animal welfare questionnaires. This research highlights the disruptive potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies applied on farms. Like the sustainability questionnaires, the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) have shortcomings. However, animal welfare indices are very useful tools to measure the performance of companies and can be easily improved by following the recommendations of this research. The importance of a formalised system of responsibilities and the advances offered by audio-visual and smart technologies, that provide real-time data, will be a key dimension for the farm of the future and therefore should be part of the BBFAW questionnaires.","Accountability; Animal Welfare; Board Of Directors; Corporate Sustainability; Digital Transformation; Forth Industrial Revolution; Governance; Management System; Sustainability; Sustainability Indices","","This research was supported by the Project: Public Emerging Subjects (FFI2016-75603-R, AEI/FEDER, UE).","Transforming Our World the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2025); Kanie, Norichika, Governing through goals: Sustainable development goals as governance innovation, pp. 1-333, (2017); Rosati, Francesco, Business contribution to the Sustainable Development Agenda: Organizational factors related to early adoption of SDG reporting, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 26, 3, pp. 588-597, (2019); Animal Rights and Human Obligations, (1989); Case for Animal Rights, (1983); Introduction to Animal Rights Your Child or the Dog, (2000); Knight, Sarah E., Human rights, animal wrongs?

This research assesses the community sustainability in Salar de Atacama, Chile. We developed a coupled natural-social systems framework to analyze the interdependencies of the lithium extraction and its impacts. Using data from the Chilean census, company sustainability reports, remote sensing, and media archives, we investigate the temporal dynamics of water availability, labor influx, employment, social activism, and corporate social responsibility. Our study finds that between 2002 and 2017, the total water storage declined at a rate of 1.16 mm/year. Compared to other uses, water consumption from Li-mining was higher by two orders of magnitude. Mining played a crucial role in creating greater migration impacts, as indicated in a high migration effectiveness index of 85% and 90%, respectively. Labor influx increased 2.3 times, whereas the role of local labor in mining decreased from 52% to 18%. Local social activism increased both in intensity and scale.

Companies have to properly communicate the SE activities, paying attention to the social, cultural, and political factors that affect the perception of stakeholders. This is particularly relevant in the tourism sector, which is a typical multistakeholder context. In the academic literature, few studies have investigated the role of the country-specific determinants of corporate social responsibility, and none of them adopt a cross-country approach. The objective of this paper is to analyze the disclosure of SE, observing the content of nonfinancial reports and company websites of all companies belonging to the Global Reporting Initiative database. Cross-country analysis confirms that European and non-European firms approach SE activities differently. The research offers a contribution to the development and improvement of company relations with stakeholders from a value cocreation perspective, identifying the areas of interest on which firms can work to advance the SE communication process.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Cross-country Analysis; Digital Communication; Stakeholders Engagement; Sustainability Report; Tourism Sector","","","Agudo-Valiente, José María, Corporate social performance and stakeholder dialogue management, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 22, 1, pp. 13-31, (2015); Amaladoss, Martin Xavier, Communicating Corporate Social Responsibility - A Case of CSR Communication in Emerging Economies, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 20, 2, pp. 65-80, (2013); Apospori, Eleni, Regional CSR policies and SMEs' CSR actions: Mind the Gap-The case of the tourism SMEs in Crete, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 7, (2018); Baldini, Maria Assunta, Role of Country- and Firm-Level Determinants in Environmental, Social, and Governance Disclosure, Journal of Business Ethics, 150, 1, pp. 79-98, (2018); Becker-Olsen, Karen L., A cross-cultural examination of corporate social responsibility marketing communications in Mexico and the United States: Strategies for global brands, Journal of International Marketing, 19, 2, pp. 30-44, (2011); Boiral, Olivier, Sustainability reports as simulacra?

Within the physical-digital networks of interactions, (fashion) brands assume a new social role largely as original contents’ producers and editors.

This research is conceptually situated within critiques of ‘digital humanitarianism’, simultaneously interrogating the role of technology in humanitarian responses and the roles of private actors who promote this technology. Our study demonstrates that a pervasive optimism concerning education technology in emergencies accompanies a surge in private actor engagement in Syrian refugee education. Findings indicate that while access to technology in educational settings is important to the Syrian refugee populations, private actors’ disproportionate focus on technology is problematic, particularly when technological interventions are viewed as panaceas for refugee education; designed free from coordination; driven by profit motivations; and developed in a manner decontextualised from the learning context. This study attends to the necessity of countering the overwhelming optimism about technology as a panacea for refugee education, which fails to problematise the implications of interventions developed in the Global North for a distant ‘other’ in the Global South.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digital Humanitarianism; Education In Emergencies; Education Technology; Private Sector; Refugee Education","","","Global Education Inc New Policy Networks and the Neo Liberal Imaginary, (2012); Digital Humanitarianism how Tech Entrepreneurs are Supporting Refugee Integration, (2016); Burns, Ryan, Moments of closure in the knowledge politics of digital humanitarianism, Geoforum, 53, pp. 51-62, (2014); Burns, Ryan, Rethinking big data in digital humanitarianism: practices, epistemologies, and social relations, GeoJournal, 80, 4, pp. 477-490, (2015); Chimni, Bhupinder S., The birth of a ""discipline"": From refugee to forced migration studies, Journal of Refugee Studies, 22, 1, pp. 11-29, (2009); undefined, (2017); Dahya, Negin, Tracing pathways to higher education for refugees: the role of virtual support networks and mobile phones for women in refugee camps, Comparative Education, 53, 2, pp. 284-301, (2017); undefined, (2013); World Bank Education for Global Development Blog, (2017); Eyben, Rosalind, Choosing words with care?

Political Corporate Social Responsibility (PCSR) theory suggests an expanded sense of politics and corporations, including impacts that may range from voluntary initiatives to overcome governance gaps, to avoiding state regulation via corporate political activity. Considering digitalization as a stimulus, we explore potential responsibilities of corporations toward public goods in contexts with functioning governments. We show that digitalization—in the form of transparency, surveillance, and data-sharing—offers corporations’ scope for deliberative public participation. The starry sky beetle infestation endangering public and private goods is thereby used to illustrate the possibility of expanding the political role of corporations in the digital sphere. We offer a contribution by conceptualizing data-deliberation as a Habermasian variation of PCSR, defined as the (a) voluntary disclosure of corporate data and its transparent, open sharing with the public sector (b) along with the cooperation with governmental institutions on data analytics methods for examining large-scale datasets (c) thereby complying with existing national and international regulations on data protection, in particular with respect to privacy and personal data.","","","","Ahammad, Mohammad Faisal, Integration of Non-market and Market Activities in Cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions, British Journal of Management, 28, 4, pp. 629-648, (2017); Albu, Oana Brindusa, Organizational Transparency: Conceptualizations, Conditions, and Consequences, Business and Society, 58, 2, pp. 268-297, (2019); Anastasiadis, Stephanos, Toward a View of Citizenship and Lobbying: Corporate Engagement in the Political Process, Business and Society, 53, 2, pp. 260-299, (2014); Anastasiadis, Stephanos, Lobbying and the responsible firm: Agenda-setting for a freshly conceptualized field, Business Ethics, 27, 3, pp. 207-221, (2018); Ball, Kirstie S., Routledge handbook of surveillance studies, pp. 1-439, (2012); Bansal, Shweta, Big data for infectious disease surveillance and modeling, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 214, pp. S375-S379, (2016); Baru, Chaitanya, How to deliver translational data-science benefits to science and society, Nature, 561, 7724, (2018); Der Asiatische Laubholzbockkafer in Bayern, (2017); Bernstein, Ethan S., The transparency paradox: A role for privacy in organizational learning and operational control, Administrative Science Quarterly, 57, 2, pp. 181-216, (2012); Bernstein, Ethan S., Making transparency transparent: The evolution of observation in management theory, Academy of Management Annals, 11, 1, pp. 217-266, (2017)","","Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd info@royensoc.co.uk","09628770","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075790145"

Changes are much more frequent than ever before. Therefore, it is important to search for innovative solutions which contribute to more effective fulfillment of goals, generate positive changes or increase value for customers and as a matter of fact, enhance innovative performance and business competitiveness. Purpose of the article: The paper deals with the presentation of eco-innovations in the business environment using creative tools of online marketing communication. Eco-innovations are a phenomenon which is present across all business activities and processes including marketing communication. The authors study such marketing activities of businesses which are part of corporate social responsibility, generate business growth and finally help to improve the global environment. The authors also present the partial results of their own quantitative marketing research in order to describe the application of SoLoMo marketing tools in the presentation of eco-innovations in the Slovak business environment. Methods: The authors prepared a standardized questionnaire on a sample of 300 Slovak busi-nesses. To test the dependence or independence of the variables, a Chi-squared test and Fisher´s exact test were used. Findings & Value added: Despite the generally growing trend of the use of modern online marketing tools, the research showed that Slovak businesses do not inform sufficiently about their eco-innovation activities, do not address all prospective target groups and do not make enough effort to enhance environmental awareness of the wider public. The results of the research will serve as basic information for the following specific studies, the main aim of which is to spread awareness among consumers and to eventually provide them with practical recommendations. In addition, the given theoretical part of the paper represents a valuable summary of information about the modern SoLoMo marketing concept while providing a detailed overview of other relevant research studies in the given field. Therefore, the paper portrays an overview of opportunities for the implementation of digital tools of marketing communication in small, medium-sized and large enterprises.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Digital Marketing; Eco-innovations; Environmental Awareness; Marketing Communication; Solomo Marketing","","The paper is part of the research project VEGA 1/0708/18 named: „Aspects of use of the SoLoMo marketing concept to enhance awareness of eco-innovations“.","Ajina, Ahmed Suhail, The perceived value of social media marketing: An empirical study of online word of mouth in Saudi Arabian context, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 6, 3, pp. 1512-1527, (2019); 6th Annual Euromed Conference of the Euromed Academy of Business Confronting Contemporary Business Challenges Through Management Innovation, (2013); Ball, Christopher Stephen, How environmental protection agencies can promote eco-innovation: The prospect of voluntary reciprocal legitimacy, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 129, pp. 242-253, (2018); Cetina, Iuliana, Modelling the influences of online social networks on consumers’ buying behaviour, Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research, 52, 2, pp. 5-20, (2018); Dewick, Paul, Focal Organisations and Eco–innovation in Consumption and Production Systems, Ecological Economics, 143, pp. 161-169, (2018); Díez-Martín, Francisco, Research challenges in digital marketing: Sustainability, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 10, (2019); Ad Alta Journal of Interdisciplinary Research, (2018); Hsieh, Ming Yuan, SoLoMo technology: exploring the most critical determinants of SoLoMo technology in the contemporary mobile communication technology era, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 9, 2, pp. 307-318, (2018); Jiang, Yu, The promising effect of a green food label in the new online market, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 3, (2019); Globalization and Its Socioeconomic Consequences 16th International Scientific Conference Proceedings Part II, (2016)","","Institute of Economic Research","1689765X; 23533293","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097545352"

We review the size, structure, and strategies of both the U.S. national and global alcohol industries and their principal marketing activities and expenditures and provide a summary of public health responses. Method: Primary data were obtained from advertising and alcohol industry market research firms and were supplemented by searches of peer-reviewed literature, business press, and online databases on global business and trade. Results: Worldwide, alcohol sales totaled more than $1.5 trillion in 2017. Control of alcoholic beverage production and marketing is concentrated globally in the hands of a small number of firms. The oligopoly structure of the producing industry helps to generate high profits per dollar invested relative to other industries, which in turn fund marketing expenditures that function as barriers to entry by other firms. Advertising expenditures are high and advertising is widespread. Stake-holder marketing and corporate social responsibility campaigns assist in maintaining a policy environment conducive to extensive alcohol marketing activity. The most common regulatory response has been alcohol industry self-regulation; statutory public health responses have made little progress in recent years and have lagged behind industry innovation in digital and social marketing. Conclusions: Alcohol marketing is widespread globally and a structural element of the alcoholic beverage industry. Given the level of alcohol-related harm worldwide, global and regional recommendations and best practices should be used to guide policy makers in effective regulation of alcohol marketing. (J. Stud.

Design/methodology/approach: The study performs an in-depth five years case study of a manufacturing firm, and reports its journey from failure in the implementation of enterprise resource planning to its success in integrating IT-based technology trends of Industry 4.0 with the firm’s core capabilities and competencies while pursuing manufacturing digitization. Findings: Industry 4.0 transition requires the organizational integration of many IT-based modern technologies and the digitization of entire value chains. However, Industry 4.0 transition for smaller manufacturers can begin with digitization of certain areas of operations in support of organizational core strategies. The development of lean-digitized manufacturing system is a viable business strategy for corporate survivability in the Industry 4.0 setting. Research limitations/implications: Although the implementation of lean-digitized manufacturing system is costly and challenging, this manufacturing strategy offers superior corporate competitiveness in the long run. Since this finding is rather limited to the present case study, assessing the business value of lean-digitized manufacturing system in a larger scale research context would be an interesting avenue for future research. Practical implications: Industry 4.0 transition for typical manufacturers should commensurate with their organizational, operational and technical particularities. Digitization of certain operations and processes, when aligned with the firm’s core strategies, capabilities and procedures, can offer superior competitiveness even in Industry 4.0 era, meaning that the strategic plan for successful Industry 4.0 transition is idiosyncratic to each particular manufacturer. Social implications: Manufacturing digitization can have deep social implications as it alters inter- and intra-organizational relationships, causes unemployment among low-skilled workforce, and raises data security and privacy concerns. Manufacturers should take responsibility for their digitization process and steer it in a direction that simultaneously safeguards economic, social and environmental sustainability. Originality/value: The strategic roadmap devised and employed by the case company for managing its digitization process can better reveal what manufacturing digitization, mandated by Industry 4.0, might require of typical manufacturers, and further enable them to better facilitate their digital transformation process.","Digitization; Industry 4.0; Information Technology; Lean Manufacturing; Manufacturing Performance; Analog To Digital Conversion; Enterprise Resource Planning; Industrial Research; Industry 4.0; Information Technology; Lean Production; Security Of Data; Social Aspects; Strategic Planning; Sustainable Development; Corporate Competitiveness; Data Security And Privacy; Design/methodology/approach; Digitized Manufacturing; Manufacturing Performance; Organizational Relationships; Small Manufacturing Firms; Social And Environmental; Competition","Analog to digital conversion; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Information technology; Lean production; Security of data; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Corporate competitiveness; Data security and privacy; Design/methodology/approach; Digitized manufacturing; Manufacturing performance; Organizational relationships; Small manufacturing firms; Social and environmental; Competition","","Abdulmalek, Fawaz A., Analyzing the benefits of lean manufacturing and value stream mapping via simulation: A process sector case study, International Journal of Production Economics, 107, 1, pp. 223-236, (2007); Handbook of Qualitative Research, (1994); Ayabakan, Sezgin, A data envelopment analysis approach to estimate IT-enabled production capability, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 41, 1, pp. 189-205, (2017); Bai, Chunguang, Investing in lean manufacturing practices: an environmental and operational perspective, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 4, pp. 1037-1051, (2019); Barata, João, Synergies between quality management and information systems: a literature review and map for further research, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 28, 3-4, pp. 282-295, (2017); Barney, Jay Bryan, The resource-based view of the firm: Ten years after 1991, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 625-641, (2001); Business Research Methods, (2003); Benitez, Jose, Information technology, the organizational capability of proactive corporate environmental strategy and firm performance: A resource-based analysis, European Journal of Information Systems, 21, 6, pp. 664-679, (2012); Buer, Sven Vegard, The link between industry 4.0 and lean manufacturing: Mapping current research and establishing a research agenda, International Journal of Production Research, 56, 8, pp. 2924-2940, (2018); Campos, Jaime, Development in the application of ICT in condition monitoring and maintenance, Computers in Industry, 60, 1, pp. 1-20, (2009)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","1741038X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070289468"

This situation served as a catalyst to accelerate some of the True Luxury Consumer trends that were beginning to gain popularity in the past few years, such as the prioritization of experiences over physical items, resulting in a tendency towards minimalism; the increased interest in sustainability, ethics, and the Corporate Social Responsibility commitments of brands; the enhanced use of online distribution channels, and the consequential need for a seamless omnichannel strategy which could effortlessly and efficiently replicate the offline, in-store experience on digital platforms; and, finally, the emergence of new ways to experience luxury goods which prioritize accessibility over ownership, such as the second-hand market for luxury as well as luxury rental services, like Rent The Runway. The pandemic has highlighted a series of issues in society, healthcare, and businesses; the consequences of these issues have been tragic, but also eye-opening for brands as well as consumers. In the clients' perspective, big companies hold the responsibility to not only provide a product or a service, but also to be helpful assets to their communities. Brands should live up to these expectations, not just to survive in the “new normal”, but also to genuinely help build a better future once the dust settles.","Consumer Behavior; Covid-19; Luxury Industry","","","True Luxury Consumer Insights Rep, (2020); Burger, Jerry M., Negative Reactions to Increases in Perceived Personal Control, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, 2, pp. 246-256, (1989); Hall, C.

To this end, it was proposed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals into the corporate social responsibility model through social dialogue. Having studied the interrelations of social dialogue and corporate social responsibility in the digital economy environment, the authors have built a theoretical model of digitalization opportunities that would affect the efficiency of social partnership. The article also proposes a methodology for assessing the quality of social dialogue, which consists of a number of indicators, including: the wages potential, the risk of unstable employment index, the general indicator of working conditions, the satisfaction with the social dialogue index. Based on the results of a qualitative analysis of social dialogue and content analysis of social labor contracts and agreements in Ukraine, the authors have designed a model of the innovation platform and experience for CSR projects and suggested ways to use digitalization opportunities to improve the quality of social dialogue and increase the efficiency of corporate social responsibility.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Digitalization; Quality Indicators Of Social Dialogue; Social Dialogue","","","This Year Metinvest Group is Directing Over Uah 30 Million to Krivoy Rog Social Programs, (2016); Aviation Industry Sectoral Agreement for 2016 2018; Order of the Ministry of Ukraine no 161 R of March 16 2016 on Approval of the Strategy for Overcoming Poverty, (2016); On Approval of the Concept for the Development of the Digital Economy and Society of Ukraine for 2018 2020 and Validation of the Plan of Measures for Its Implementation, (2018); Man Society Economy Intellectualisation and Humanisation of Work, (2017); Collective Agreement Between the Administration of the State Territorial Branch Association South Western Railway and the Road Committee of the Trade Union of Railwaymen and Available on the Internet Transport Builders of Ukraine, (2018); Transparency Index of Ukrainian Companies Websites 2017, (2017); Social Dialogue and Economic Performance What Matters for Business A Review, (2017); Collective Agreement for 2017, (2017); Ukraine Naec Energoatom Got the First Place Among State Owned Companies on the Transparency Index, (2018)","","Universidad Compultense Madrid","18858031; 11356618","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111079363"

Following the technological and digital development in recent years, more attention is given to socially responsible creation and implementation of innovation. Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), which in recent months has been taking formal shape, is a new initiative within social responsibility. CDR means the awareness of duties binding the organisations active in the field of technological development and using technologies to provide services.

On the one hand, CAVs bring to light theoretical and practical challenges to the implementation of the multi-dimensional obligations of the current European personal data protection legal framework, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ePrivacy Directive,1 and where applicable, the Directive for a high common level of security and information systems (NIS Directive or NISD).2 As mere examples, CAV developers currently face multiple legal hurdles to overcome, including the necessity to fulfil controller and/or processor obligations in complex data processing scenarios3 and tensions with the GDPR's principle of purpose limitation4 (which comes at odds with the autonomous processing of personal data through AI in the CAV, which may be based on a (re)interpretation of goals, or, possibly, a shift in focus from the original goal for which personal data was collected). Additionally, the overall need for relatively large datasets to properly train and leverage AI functionalities leads to conflicts with the principle of data minimization.5 When applied to AI systems, the requirement of data protection by design and by default also presents difficulties, as data protection by default is possible only when the necessary personal data is processed for a specific purpose.6 Moreover, the ePrivacy Directive has been interpreted by European Supervisory Authorities - notably, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)7 - as requiring a company wishing to store or access information stored within a CAV to obtain specific consent from CAV users for these specific activities. Furthermore, an additional legal basis must be determined (possibly necessitating those companies to make a double request for consent) for any subsequent use of the information stored or accessed, such as the analysis of telematics data collected from a CAV. This interpretation creates challenges at the technical and legal levels in particular where the legal basis defined for subsequent use of CAV information is not consent, such as in the case of pay-as-you-drive insurance, where the contract entered into between the CAV user and an insurance company serves as a legal basis for the processing of their personal data. A conflict between the legal basis used for information storage/access - consent, which must be freely withdrawable under the GDPR8 - and the legal basis used for information use - e.g., performance of a contract, which will typically not be compatible with the possibility for the CAV user to freely prevent the insurance company from continuing to process their personal data emerges in this context. Concerns from the data security9 perspective are also highly relevant, notably due to the lack of shared security standards in the CAV domain and the increase of potential attack surface caused by the interconnection of different CAV components.10 On the other hand, while European data protection legislation such as the GDPR, ePrivacy and NISD provide a minimum level of legal safeguards for citizens, they may not suffice to maximize CAV benefits for users while minimizing their potential negative impact on society.11 In order to properly and comprehensively address the risks brought about by CAVs, ethics12 and human rights concerns must therefore take a central role in every stage of the CAV development lifecycle, embedding the notions of fairness, transparency, and security into design processes. Transparency13 is situated between the legal and ethical dimensions and is challenged by the complexity of AI systems, as well as the inherent autonomy and flexibility of automated decision-making, and is key in the development of the framework as a prerequisite for trustworthy, ethical, and fair data processing. This paper explores the closely linked legal principles and ethical aspects that should be taken into consideration by stakeholders in the CAV landscape and provides a roadmap to be used by CAV researchers, developers, and all those who seek to create and implement technologies to carry out data processing activities within such domain in a compliant, fair and trustworthy manner. As a result of the inherent link between the legal and ethical concerns, the authors will present a holistic approach to design and development which is intended to overcome the challenges posed to European personal data protection legal principles and obligations, by involving ethics and fairness. This approach, which goes beyond minimum legal requirements and proposes the application of a multidisciplinary framework, can be defined as Data Protection as a Corporate Social Responsibility in accordance to the Maastricht methodology in this domain.14","Artificial Intelligence; Automated Vehicles; Connected; Corporate Social Responsibility; Data Protection; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Behavioral Research; Decision Making; Digital Storage; Economic And Social Effects; Information Use; Insurance; Large Dataset; Life Cycle; Philosophical Aspects; Professional Aspects; Regulatory Compliance; Social Aspects; Transparency; Automated Decision Making; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Data Protection By Defaults; Design And Development; Emerging Technologies; Eprivacy Directives; General Data Protection Regulations; Supervisory Authority; Privacy By Design","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Information use; Insurance; Large dataset; Life cycle; Philosophical aspects; Professional aspects; Regulatory compliance; Social aspects; Transparency; Automated decision making; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Data protection by defaults; Design and Development; Emerging technologies; Eprivacy directives; General data protection regulations; Supervisory authority; Privacy by design","","A Novel Adaptive Cybersecurity Framework for the Internet of Vehicles Niove; Guia De Privacidad Desde El Diseno, (2019); Guia De Proteccion De Datos Por Defecto; Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment Dpia and Determining Whether Processing is Likely to Result in A High Risk for the Purposes of Regulation 2016 679, (2017); Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Guidelines on Consent Under Regulation 2016 679, (2018); Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Opinion 03 2010 on the Principle of Accountability, (2010); Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Opinion 03 2013 on Purpose Limitation, (2013); Article 29 Data Protection Working Party Opinion 08 2014 on the Recent Developments on the Internet of Things, (2014); Blog Post, (2019); European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity Ecpc","Giannakopoulos, G.; Galiotou, E.; Vasillas, N.","CEUR-WS","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104660519"

The future is 2030. The methodology includes 20 in-depth interviews with researchers working with these issues in the Swedish telecommunication company Telia and the Norwegian telecommunication company Telenor. These are both companies making their living of understanding the future of work both on a corporate level. We did the interviews in April 2019 and during the Coronavirus in April 2020. The findings: 1.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics will be an incremental revolution introduced step by step. 2.The Coronavirus has reorganized work as online work at home, and a more significant part of the online work willorganize as online digital work at home and virtual teamwork. 3.Video conferences have come to stay, giving less business traveling. 4.Greener national supply-chains will partly replace the global supply chains. 5.The workforce will be more disciplined and loyal, have better competence (knowledge, skills, and attitudes), andmore women as middle managers and top managers. 6.The incentive system will be based more upon an internal corporate pipeline. 7.The corporations will take a more energetic responsibility for greener solutions and the climate. 8.The households will be using more reused goods, traveling less, and have a greener living focus. The difference between April 2019 to April 2020 is that online homework is the actual work situation in March-April 2020, and the interviewed believe that 50% of the work will be done online outside the workplace.

Design/methodology/approach: To apply MO in CDR, this study recommends adoption of a behavior change framework comprising of the co-creation, build and engage (CBE) model and proposes the creation of consumer segments based on generational cohort and tailoring strategies through motivation, opportunity and ability (MOA) model to manage vulnerability. Findings: The study specifies that managing consumer data vulnerability requires a unique strategy different from conventional service delivery. A holistic approach is recommended by integrating corporate digital responsibility as a pivotal element of organizational strategy and by positioning vulnerable customers as a critical stakeholder. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the research in corporate social responsibility (CSR), privacy and data vulnerability in the banking sector in two prominent ways: first, the study demonstrates the importance of MO as a premise to develop a novel version of CDR called market-oriented digital responsibility (MODR). The study considers MODR as a strategy to reposition vulnerable consumers as a key stakeholder, and, second, the study proposes an innovative set of consumer segments based on data vulnerability and introduces a data vulnerability growth model (DVGM) connecting vulnerability with age.","Corporate Digital Responsibility; Corporate Social Marketing; Data Vulnerability; Market Orientation; Online Banking; Privacy Concerns","","","Acquisti, Alessandro, Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, Science, 347, 6221, pp. 509-514, (2015); Acquisti, Alessandro, The economics of privacy, Journal of Economic Literature, 54, 2, pp. 442-492, (2016); Adorjan, Michael C., A New Privacy Paradox?

Furthermore, this study used interactive analysis techniques consisting of data reduction, data analysis, and conclusion as the data analysis techniques. The results indicate that there is suitability between the implementation of the school literacy movement in vocational high schools in Indonesia and the guideline for the school literacy movement provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture. Currently, the stages of habituation, development, and implementation of learning based on the school literacy movement have been implemented. Nevertheless, there were several inhibiting factors, including the limited availability of books, less convenient library arrangement, low students’ reading interest, limited reading time due to various school activities, and limited facilities and funds to support the school literacy movement-related activities. As the implication of this study, several aspects are required, namely: collaboration between school and community as well as alumni network, convenient library, the provision of digital books, creative competitions related to the school literacy movement, and access to Corporate Social Responsibility funds from the business and industrial sector.","Implications; Inhibiting Factors; School Literacy Movement; Smk; Vocational High School","","","Ali, Azwadi, Financial Satisfaction and the Influence of Financial Literacy in Malaysia, Social Indicators Research, 120, 1, pp. 137-156, (2015); International Encyclopedia of Media Literacy, (2019); Bangert-Drowns, Robert L., The effects of school-based writing-to-learn interventions on academic achievement: A meta-analysis, Review of Educational Research, 74, 1, pp. 29-58, (2004); Nga Center for Best Practices, (2009); Pancaran Pendidikan, (2018); Higher Education Management, (2001); Research Design Qualitative Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, (2003); Journal of Language Literature and Education, (2018); Handbook of Qualitative Research, (2000); Handbook of Educational Psychology, (2006)","","Common Ground Research Networks","2327266X; 23270136","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097216741"

The article reflects the results of studies based on an interdisciplinary approach to the economic development by supply chain strategy and labor partnership. The work is aimed at clarifying the concept of supply chain management and labor partnership as an economic category. Therefore, this concept has been studied through the synthesis of jurisprudence, conflict management, sociology and political science, which allows to identify the economic and microeconomic substances of this phenomenon. The former is considered through the labor market trends and conditions, and quantified in derived parameters of supply chain and social-labor relations depending on it. The latter, as a specific type of management, is formed at the intersection of entrepreneurial, systemic management under limited conditions for self-management model implementation, typical for modern transition to the information, digital economy. Thus, a model of supply chain strategy and labor partnership has been developed as a microeconomic category, implying the impact characteristic of such management tools as investments in human capital, development of corporate culture, adequacy of compensation policies and supply chain responsibility tools, on social capital, considered as a synergistic amount of company's human capital realized to the full. Additionally, a set of indicators developed in the course of research, and their dynamics can be used to monitor general trends in supply chain and labor partnership as an economic category.

Consideration of the interrelation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and public relations highlights new areas for exploration and engagement. Both the dialogical and semantic perspectives reveal the performative and conversational aspects of social media. In general, both the linguistic panorama of CSR and digital media as part of a PR strategy open new possibilities for a dialogical, interactive, meaningful relationship strategy for corporate image management. Based on the linguistic approach to CSR and the Communication Management Approach, this paper explores the linguistic use of Twitter as a primary dialogical strategy to effectively enhance interactive dialogue-based relationships with the stakeholders of the top 50 companies in the energy sector based on tweet data from 2016. Semantic analysis was conducted by advanced text mining and clustering techniques on 3042 tweets monitored in 2017 that contained the leading CSR-related hash-tags and keywords. The results demonstrated that the top energy companies apply a defensive and symbolic perspective, mainly for branding purposes. The corporate discourse dominates over a meaningful conversational strategy to foster interaction with stakeholders around sustainability issues on Twitter. The study reveals a homogenized interrelation between CSR, social media, and public relations. The results reveal a tendency for isomorphy in the communication models applied by the companies in the energy sector. Furthermore, similarities in semantics and thus strong tendencies to mutually mimic dialogical strategies are also observed.

Based on this vision, the Sarawak Government has addressed the critical need for an effective collaboration with the local organisations. Since the early 2000s, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become one of the innovative mechanism used by governments of various localities to work with local organisations for the interest of the community. In some regions, CSR has been widely used as a platform to cope with the social challenges such as unemployment and poverty. Based on these common practices, it is reasonable for this study to anticipate the likelihoo d for similar mechanism of collaboration to take place in Sarawak especially in respective to the joint effort required between the Sarawak Government with the local organisations to ensure successful implementation of SDE. This perspective in turn, puts into emphasis the potential ‘trigger’ effect that SDE may impose on the affected local organisations, including its CSR activities and orientation. Henceforth, the need for this study to view the development and implementation of CSR in an organisation as a sensemaking process. In this respect, this article takes the pioneering step to put present a conceptual view of the organisational CSR sensemaking process, and rationalise as to how CSR should be analysed especially in the scope of Sarawak’s current economic plan and direction.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Csr Sensemaking; Organizational Sensemaking; Sarawak Digital Economy; Sensemaking","","The authors wish to express the utmost appreciation to Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (KPM), Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for supporting the conduct of this study.","Journal of Communication, (2013); Business Ethics A European Review, (2008); Angus-Leppan, Tamsin, Leadership styles and CSR practice: An examination of sensemaking, institutional drivers and CSR leadership, Journal of Business Ethics, 93, 2, pp. 189-213, (2010); Academy of Management Journal, (1985); Basu, Kunal, Corporate social responsibility: A process model of sensemaking, Academy of Management Review, 33, 1, pp. 122-136, (2008); Towards the National Vision Policy Review of the New Economic Policy and New Development Policy Among the Bumiputera Communities in Sarawak, (2003); Jurnal Undang Undang Dan Masyarakat, (2008); Advancing into Digital World, (2017); Bouquet, Cyril, Weight versus voice: How foreign subsidiaries gain attention from corporate headquarters, Academy of Management Journal, 51, 3, pp. 577-601, (2008); Calabrese, Armando, Turning corporate social responsibility-driven opportunities in competitive advantages: A two-dimensional model, Knowledge and Process Management, 20, 1, pp. 50-58, (2013)","","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press chiefgema@gmail.com UKM Bangi, Sengalor 43600","22891528; 2289151X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083055170"

We identify three overarching reasons that justify the need for new ways of teaching that further incorporate technology to foster the innovative thinking needed to tackle imminent societal grand challenges such as climate change and increasing inequality. First, we are facing a new generation of millennials and Generation Z students who are digital natives and more likely to search for educational content on their electronic devices. Second, new technologies offer opportunities to reach students globally, helping to democratize education. Third, we posit that the intrinsic characteristics of societal grand challenges, which are complex, uncertain, and evaluative, can benefit from technology as an effective translator of multilayered concepts into more digestible action items.

Uniqueness of Beale’s approach stems from the deep-seated social purpose of insurance to support development of trust in a complex asset management cyberspace. Beale’s collaborative approach to dealing with risk in a digitally connected asset market is exclusive in its ethos. At a time when digital assets are threatened by cyberattacks and losses that are many times in magnitude in comparison with those of natural calamities, Beale’s innovative leadership is likely to fit in with a boundary-less online context. Beale’s enunciation of leadership aspirations for Lloyd’s has striking similarities with recent research on digital transformation of organizations and provides a practical articulation of collaborative trust building within the insurance market and beyond.","Environmental Responsibility; Global Strategy; Individual Ceo/ Decision Making; Information Systems; Leadership","","The authors would like to thank Dame Inga Beale who kindly agreed to allow them to develop Dame Inga’s interview in Bristol Business School’s Distinguished Executive Address series for this article.

Sustainability standards (i.e. best-practice operational procedures, including sector-specific certification programs) have emerged to mitigate these impacts and improve the benefits for impacted communities. Best-practice design, implementation and verification of sustainability standards underpinning certification programs requires active participation by Indigenous Peoples. This study uses literature review and a survey of key informants to both map the literature relevant to the participation of Indigenous Peoples in extractives industry certification programs and standards, and to highlight best-practices in program governance and assurance processes. There is little literature on Indigenous Peoples’ participation in certification program governance and assurance processes. The literature is dominated by reporting on the environmental and socio-cultural impacts of extractives developments for Indigenous Peoples, and associated conflicts and negotiations/agreements to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes consistent with international norms. In this context, there is an increasing focus on Indigenous Peoples’ ‘Free, Prior & Informed Consent’ (FPIC). Key informants identified few best-practice examples of Indigenous Peoples’ participation in sustainability standards for extractives. Most emphasised the importance of Indigenous Peoples’ FPIC in project development, operation and completion. Discussions also highlighted limitations of standard assurance processes and the potential for simple but innovatively-applied digital technologies to support Indigenous Peoples’ participation in data collection for auditing. A key concern for Indigenous communities impacted by extractives developments is effective rehabilitation of their biocultural landscapes, incorporating environmental values, cultural traditions (i.e. obligations and practices) and provision for sustainable livelihoods. The study's findings provide guidance for certification program managers, extractives operators and auditors to improve engagement of Indigenous Peoples in certification program governance and assurance processes.","Biocultural Landscape Rehabilitation; Certification; Consultation; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Free Prior And Informed Consent (fpic); Governance And Assurance Processes; Certification; Corporate Social Responsibility; Indigenous Population; Mining Industry; Standard (regulation); Sustainability","certification; corporate social responsibility; indigenous population; mining industry; standard (regulation); sustainability","","Adam, Marie Christine, Expert opinion on the criteria and indicator process and aboriginal communities: Are objectives being met?, Forestry Chronicle, 87, 3, pp. 358-366, (2011); Anderson, Patrick, Free, prior, and informed consent?

However, they are responsible for a vast amount of environmental damage and destruction. The creation, processing, storage and movement of data relies on extensive natural and finite resources including electricity, water, metals, elements and chemicals as well as the production of human-made materials including plastics and glass; the disposal of these materials can produce toxic waste which is often illegally hidden and shipped around the world to bypass responsibility. Despite clear evidence of the materiality of digital flows, corporate rhetoric artfully acts to conceal the environmental risks and costs of digital flows, while state and international policy and regulation has thus far been unable to produce an effective response. This article seeks to examine the roots of this problem by reviewing the historical global policy discourse on the digital economy. The article is also grounded in Asia – which now accounts for almost half of the world’s Internet users – by looking close up at State policies in the second most economically advanced country in the region: Singapore. The article concludes with a discussion of what needs to happen if states are to reduce the environmental burden of the digital economy and ensure the costs are more justly distributed.","Asia; Data Centres; Data Flows; Data Storage; Digital Economy; E-waste; Environment; Policy; Singapore","","This paper emerges from an Australian Research Council funded Discovery project titled, Data Centres and the Governance of Labour and Territory.

Developing local action plans (LAPs) for ash dieback is promoted by the government as way for local authorities to plan an effective strategic response at a landscape scale. However, risk assessment frameworks and the knowledge about ash dieback that is needed for quality decisionmaking at this level is still lacking. The scientific uncertainty around ash dieback progression, mortality rates, and the hazards presented by the trees at different stages of infection present knowledge problems. The research aims to (i) develop and evaluate an approach to addressing ash dieback suited to local authorities across the United Kingdom, and (ii) address the research gaps surrounding the local authority approaches to risk assessment and overcoming ""knowledge problems."" Our hypothesis is that action research can be used to develop an effective risk assessment framework and knowledge tools that can improve decision-making. Our research questions in support of these objectives are: (i) How do local authorities perceive, assess, and plan for risks? (ii) What information and knowledge do local authorities need to assess and manage the specific risks of ash dieback? Lastly, (iii) what processes drive the local authorities toward preparing and implementing LAPs? Data collection occurred between 2015-2019 and included: deliberative co-production and validation workshops, two survey questionnaires, and evaluative semistructured interviews (SSIs). Local authorities were shown to assess risk and proportionality of response to ash dieback through processes of deliberative social learning mixing opinion, scientific and practice-based knowledge to reach a consensus over the methods and knowledge that would be used in decision-making. Placing ash dieback on corporate risk registers that cut across the multiple departments dealing with the problem facilitated political approval, action planning, and budget allocation. Generating locally specific knowledge and finding the resources and personnel to drive forward strategic planning and implementation were key to landscape scale responses and ratifying LAPs. Collaborative action research working on ways of assessing, learning, and responding to tree pests and diseases offer an important approach to problem-solving and developing responses at the landscape scale.","Ash Dieback; Biosecurity; Knowledge Problems; Risk Assessment; Social Learning; Tree Health; Trees Outside Forests; Budget Control; Decision Making; Digital Storage; Forestry; Health Risks; Surveys; Bio-security; Knowledge Problems; Social Learning; Tree Health; Trees Outside Forests; Risk Assessment; Dieback; Forest Health; Fungal Disease; Knowledge; Learning; Risk Assessment; Tree; Asia; Cost Control; Decision Making; Risk Assessment; United Kingdom; Fraxinus; Hymenoscyphus","Budget control; Decision making; Digital storage; Forestry; Health risks; Surveys; Bio-security; Knowledge problems; Social learning; Tree health; Trees outside forests; Risk assessment; dieback; forest health; fungal disease; knowledge; learning; risk assessment; tree; Asia; Cost Control; Decision Making; Risk Assessment; United Kingdom; Fraxinus; Hymenoscyphus","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, under Phase 2 of the Future Proofing Plant Health project No. PH0469.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, under Phase 2 of the Future Proofing Plant Health project No. PH0469.

The paper analyzes the interconnections between commercial publishers’ and authors’ interest and argue that Open Access Repositories could be considered as an instrument towards common benefits. In the context of continuous technological growth OA could be also seen as an alternative instrument for the protection of intellectual property to facilitate modern or digital publishing and benefit publisher and intellectual creator, as well. Traditionally, commercial publishers are ‘gatekeepers’ of the standards of merit of academic works even though they get almost all of the profits. However, while they rely on academics’ expertise to remain commercially viable they do not pay for this expertise, appropriately. In contemporary days it is feasible for authors to not rely on commercial publishers. It is therefore in the interests of commercial publishers that academics keep publishing with them. As gatekeepers of standards of merit they can benefit the academic world and remain viable themselves.

Once they have found the right path for themselves organizations realize that during the 4-th industrial revolution the implementation of a new technology is no longer the obstacle to develop but the people in the organization who don't want to question everything and are not ready for a change. Hence, the toughest question to answer is how to create a digital culture. Here, we see the new role of the universities and business schools, who need to get out of their comfort zone of conservatism and build up new trusty relationships with all stakeholders involved within the education process. Because the digital transformation has changed completely the nature of the relationships with the customer, it is 24/7 like it or not thanks to the new connectivity, the numerous opportunities to choose the eco system you want to belong, etc. The current eco system of developing sustainable business is affected massively by this revolutionary shift and is changing the enterprise landscape for good.

Nevertheless, this is less than required and by the time funds are raised for new infrastructure, somewhere other existing infrastructure may be in need of upgrade; in essence, need of continuous and sustainable fund flow is need of the hour. However, when infrastructure funding is done,economic infrastructuregets default priority over social infrastructure. We find that plenty of funds which are available with individuals and companies are not utilized just because we don’t have a convenient and efficient channel to route funds to specific projects. We analyse social infrastructure financing and limitations of financing capabilities, how alternative funding methods like crowdfunding can help in narrowing the funding gap.

Also, it can channelize India Inc’s unspent Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) amount which stood at almost 60k crore in duration of FY15-18; mostly due to inability to identify project to spend [3]. This platform can be promising and support in continuous and hassle-free flow of funds to the major/minor projects. Moreover, India is gearing up for smart cities and rapid urbanization and it’s a sane thing to seek solutions before the issues arrive.

This, we argue, points to the need for a digital transformation of our understanding of academic fields, one that does justice to the important role of communication in the production and recreation of academic fields. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the “communicative constitution of organizations” (CCO) view to explore how academic fields are communicatively constituted. Our GABEK-based discourse analysis focuses on the communicative constitution of the academic field of corporate social responsibility. Our findings illustrate how academic fields are constituted through the enactment of three communicative practices: embedding, diverging, and converging. Furthermore, our results indicate how the communicative constitution of academic fields occurs through the sequential enactment of these practices. Our theoretical framework extends the literatures on scientific communities and CCO by beginning to develop a communication view of academic fields.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the SME owner-managers’ attitudes toward the pace of technological innovation, and it examines their perceived use and ease of digital media for stakeholder engagement. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology integrated measuring items from the technology acceptance model, the pace of technological innovation and corporate social responsibility, to better understand the SME owner-managers’ rationale for using digital media. The respondents were expected to reveal their attitudes toward commercial, ethical and social responsibilities. Findings: A factor analysis indicated that the SME owner-managers were perceiving the usefulness of digital media to engage with marketplace stakeholders. Whilst, a stepwise regression analysis reported positive and significant relationships between the pace of technological innovation and the SMEs’ perceived usefulness of digital media for communication purposes. The results also revealed that young owner-managers from large SMEs were more likely to utilize digital media than their smaller counterparts.

We posit that these directors (i) drive the creation of a CSR committee to advise them on social and environmental issues, and (ii) promote the use of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards (jointly, the GRI-IFC strategy) in their CSR disclosure. The GRI-IFC strategy requires the disclosure of key indicators, and is expected to strengthen stakeholder engagement and to enhance the firm's internal monitoring. Our analysis of an unbalanced sample of 750 international companies, spanning the period 2011–2016, in which logistic and ordinal regressions are applied to the panel data, reveals a generalised absence of direct involvement by independent directors in the adoption of the GRI-IFC strategy. However, in many cases these directors promote the creation of a CSR committee to advice the board on the voluntary implementation of the GRI-IFC strategy. Our evidence shows that the CSR committee plays a mediating role in the cause-effect relationship between independent directors and their adoption of the GRI-IFC strategy.","Corporate Social Report; Csr Committee; Gri; Ifc; Independent Directors; Digital Storage; International Trade; Cause-effect Relationships; Corporate Social Report; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Csr Committee; Global Reporting Initiative; Independent Directors; International Finance Corporations; Social And Environmental; Economic And Social Effects","Digital storage; International trade; Cause-effect relationships; Corporate social report; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); CSR committee; Global Reporting Initiative; Independent directors; International finance corporations; Social and environmental; Economic and social effects","","Amor-Esteban, Víctor, An extension of the industrial corporate social responsibility practices index: New information for stakeholder engagement under a multivariate approach, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 26, 1, pp. 127-140, (2019); Amor-Esteban, Víctor, Useful information for stakeholder engagement: A multivariate proposal of an Industrial Corporate Social Responsibility Practices Index, Sustainable Development, 26, 6, pp. 620-637, (2018); Amran, Azlan Bin, The influence of governance structure and strategic corporate social responsibility toward sustainability reporting quality, Business Strategy and the Environment, 23, 4, pp. 217-235, (2014); Arena, Claudia, Environmental Reporting: Transparency to Stakeholders or Stakeholder Manipulation?

The requirement for introducing corporate social responsibility is explained primarily by the companies’ growing awareness of their obligations to society. Companies in the modern world tend to do business with due account of the current social tasks and issues. Those businesses that do consider the implications of their operations make corporate social responsibility their strategic priority. The pioneers in corporate social responsibility, who were the first to speak openly on the topic, were Mr. G. Swope, President of General Electric, and Mr. W. Gifford, President of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The idea of the social responsibility of business has spread all over the world and was adopted by many companies, resulting in the emergence of the concept of corporate social responsibility. Today, business is a valid corporate citizen exercising its influence on the social, economic and political environment. As such, it may not allow itself to neglect the social background of its activities since it may result in the deterioration of its public image and the way it is perceived by its consumers and investors.","Concept Of Social Responsibility; Digital Economy; Evolution Of Accounting Methods And Procedures; Standardization; Synergistic Approach","","","Materials of the International Part Time Scientificpractical Conference, (2015); undefined, (2010); Modern Concepts of Accounting and Reporting Textbook, (2018); Karpova, T.

In this digital age when companies are confronted with massive sets of data, integration of financial and non-financial data, little empirical evidence exists on how sustainability issues are integrated or linked within internal corporate information systems. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based survey, hypothesis testing, principal component methods and hierarchical clustering are used to provide original empirical evidence from major Lithuanian companies. Findings: The main findings reveal that most companies surveyed include a sustainability strategy in their core strategy, but there is a lack of linkage with measuring and integrating sustainability outcomes within the entirety of corporate financial results. Unexpectedly, the association between stakeholders' involvement and sustainability accounting information system design was not as strong as hypothesized theoretically. Therefore, it deserves further investigation, constituting an important implication for future research. Specifically, three profiles of sustainability accounting information systems were explained, namely, integrated, fragmented and compliance systems. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study relate to the small sample size, as sustainability-related information is still regarded quite confidential. Practical implications: This result could serve as a specific reference for companies to apply integrated sustainability accounting information systems that might serve as a good practice model for companies, however, fragmented and compliance profiles are the prevailing ones. Social implications: The findings are important for fostering corporate social responsibility by developing sustainability accounting information systems. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the sustainability accounting and information systems literature by providing empirical evidence linking contingent factors with the development of sustainability accounting information systems.","Contingent Factors; Information Systems; Principal Component Methods; Strategy; Sustainability Accounting","","","Adams, Carol A., Measurement of sustainability performance in the public sector, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 5, 1, pp. 46-67, (2014); Adams, Carol A., Integrating sustainability reporting into management practices, Accounting Forum, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2008); Adams, Carol A., Making a difference: Sustainability reporting, accountability and organisational change, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 20, 3, pp. 382-402, (2007); Adams, Carol A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporate social and ethical reporting: Beyond current theorising, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 15, 2, pp. 223-250, (2002); Alewine, Hank C., Accounting systems' design matters: Evaluability and mode influence environmental performance judgments, Advances in Accounting Behavioral Research, 20, pp. 23-62, (2017); Ammar, Sameh Farhat, Enterprise systems, business process management and UK-management accounting practices: Cross-sectional case studies, Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 14, 3, pp. 230-281, (2017); Bebbington, Jan, Accounting and sustainable development: Reflections and propositions, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 48, pp. 21-34, (2017); Bebbington, Jan, The production of normativity: A comparison of reporting regimes in Spain and the UK, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 37, 2, pp. 78-94, (2012); Bebbington, Jan, Initiating sustainable development reporting: Evidence from New Zealand, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 22, 4, pp. 588-625, (2009); Bebbington, Jan, Accounting technologies and sustainability assessment models, Ecological Economics, 61, 2-3, pp. 224-236, (2007)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","2040803X; 20408021","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066831809"

In this institutional discourse about moral responsibilities, corporate actors aim at defending the legitimacy of digital platforms. This study conceptualizes strategic communication as a means for conveying conformity to legitimacy expectations, to shape legitimacy judgments, and to discursively conduct institutional work. A critical discourse analysis of Zuckerberg’s testimony before the European Parliament finds that pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy is signaled through corporate ability, responsibility, and conformity narratives, respectively. Moreover, Zuckerberg’s techno-libertarian talk advocates Silicon Valley ideology through utility narratives of artificial intelligence. Thus, Zuckerberg conducts institutional work as an institutional entrepreneur whose strategic communication seeks to manipulate views as well as institutions.","","","","Alvesson, Mats, Uninhibited Institutionalisms, Journal of Management Inquiry, 28, 2, pp. 119-127, (2019); Organization Science, (1990); Bannister, Frank E., The fourth power: ICT and the role of the administrative state in protecting democracy, Information Polity, 23, 3, pp. 307-323, (2018); Beattie, Vivien A., Investigating presentational change in U.K. annual reports: A longitudinal perspective, Journal of Business Communication, 45, 2, pp. 181-222, (2008); Bitektine, Alex, The ""macro"" and the ""micro"" of legitimacy: Toward a multilevel theory of the legitimacy process, Academy of Management Review, 40, 1, pp. 49-75, (2015); Campbell, John L., Why would corporations behave in socially responsible ways?

The purpose of this paper is to critically reflect on the state-of-the-art in academic research on CSR communication concepts, strategies and future scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: The editorial critically evaluates existing academic research dealing with CSR communication in the digital age. More precisely, it analyses established theories and concepts of CSR communication in terms of their fit to meet future challenges. Findings: It can be noted that CSR communication practice is heading for new shores. Economic pressure, legal and political requirements, reputation risks in a digital media ecology and a new civic-minded and well-being-oriented generation of employees require a reorientation of CSR communication from information to impact orientation. Thus, the authors complement the approach of communication about CSR with the concept of communicative responsibility as a normative framework for corporate communication in the future. Originality/value: The analyzed literature as well as the papers of the CSR Communication Conference indicate that the authors are heading toward a future of impact- instead of information-oriented communication. Here, communicative responsibility comes in as a fourth dimension of corporate responsibility, offering a normative framework for strategic, impact-oriented sustainability communication, integrated reporting and internal CSR.","Communicative Responsibility; Csr Communication; Impact; Internal Csr; Reporting","","","Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Bhattacharya, C.

In particular, exposure to misleading beauty imagery is linked with greater body dissatisfaction, worse mood, poorer self-esteem, and increased risk for disordered eating behaviors. Moreover, given the social, psychological, medical, and economic burden of eating disorders, there is an urgent need to address environmental risk factors and to scale up prevention efforts by increasing the regulation of digitally altered advertising imagery. METHODS: This manuscript summarizes the health research literature linking digital retouching of advertising to increased risk of eating disorders, disordered weight and appearance control behaviors, and body dissatisfaction in consumers, followed by a review of global policy initiatives designed to regulate digital retouching to reduce health harms to consumers. Next, we turn to the US legal context, reporting on findings generated through legal research via Westlaw and LexisNexis, congressional records, federal agency websites, law review articles, and Supreme Court opinions, in addition to consulting legal experts on both tax law and the First Amendment, to evaluate the viability of various policy initiatives proposed to strengthen regulation on digital retouching in the United States. FINDINGS: Influencing advertising practices via tax incentives combined with corporate social responsibility initiatives may be the most constitutionally feasible options for the US legal context to reduce the use of digitally alternated images of models' bodies in advertising. CONCLUSIONS: Policy and corporate initiatives to curtail use of digitally altered images found to be harmful to mental and behavioral health of consumers could reduce the burden of eating disorders, disordered weight and appearance control behaviors, and body dissatisfaction and thereby improve population health in the United States.","Advertising; Cosmetic Industry; Eating Disorder; Economics; Health Care Policy; Human; Image Processing; Legislation And Jurisprudence; Mass Medium; Procedures; Public Health; Self Concept; Social Responsibility; Tax; United States; Advertising; Beauty Culture; Body Dissatisfaction; Feeding And Eating Disorders; Health Policy; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-assisted; Income Tax; Mass Media; Public Health; Self Concept; Social Responsibility","advertising; cosmetic industry; eating disorder; economics; health care policy; human; image processing; legislation and jurisprudence; mass medium; procedures; public health; self concept; social responsibility; tax; United States; Advertising; Beauty Culture; Body Dissatisfaction; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Health Policy; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Income Tax; Mass Media; Public Health; Self Concept; Social Responsibility","†† Michigan State University College of Law, East Lansing, MI, USA †† Department of Psychology, Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, USA †† Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.

Through an examination of corporate blogs and sponsored stories, this article argues these companies cultivate risk along two related axes: (a) fear of dangerous others; and (b) fear of the threat posed by personal information available to others. Through sponsored stories and promotional material, these companies encourage people to mitigate risk by using consumer background check services to seek out information about others and review available details about themselves. Consistent with other forms of risk anxiety in modern cultures, the advice offered by these companies encourages the acceptance of personal responsibility around the acquisition of and response to this information. This article concludes by arguing the cultivation of reputation anxiety around digital skeletons-belonging both to others and to oneself-is rooted in gendered notions of safety and personal responsibility.","Consumer Background Checks; Neoliberalism; Online Reputation; Reputation Anxiety; Risk Society","","","Uneasy Access Privacy for Women in A Free Society, (1988); Ispy Surveillance and Power in the Interactive Era, (2007); Banet-Weiser, Sarah, Authentic™: The politics of ambivalence in a brand culture, pp. 1-265, (2012); Banks, James, The Heartbleed bug: Insecurity repackaged, rebranded and resold, Crime, Media, Culture, 11, 3, pp. 259-279, (2015); Reflexive Modernization Politics Tradition and Aesthetics in the Modern Social Order, (1994); Bucher, Taina, Want to be on the top?

At the core of machine ethics is the handling of personal data and the security of machine operations. Yet, privacy and security engineering are a challenge in today's business world where personal data markets, corporate deadlines, and a lack of perfectionism frame the context in which engineers need to work. Besides these organizational and market challenges, each engineer has his or her specific view on the importance of these values that can foster or inhibit taking them into consideration. We present the results of an empirical study of 124 engineers based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Jonas' Principle of Responsibility to understand the drivers and impediments of ethical system development as far as privacy and security engineering are concerned. We find that many engineers find the two values important, but do not enjoy working on them. We also find that many struggle with the organizational environment: They face a lack of time and autonomy that is necessary for building ethical systems, even at this basic level. Organizations' privacy and security norms are often too weak or even oppose value-based design, putting engineers in conflict with their organizations. Our data indicate that it is largely engineers' individually perceived responsibility as well as a few character traits that make a positive difference to ethical system development.","Engineering Behavior; Ethics; Privacy; Responsibility; Security; Value-based Design; Values; Behavioral Research; Commerce; Engineers; Philosophical Aspects; Security Systems; Ethics; Responsibility; Security; Value-based; Values; Data Privacy","Behavioral research; Commerce; Engineers; Philosophical aspects; Security systems; ethics; responsibility; security; Value-based; values; Data privacy","","Moor, James H., The nature, importance, and difficulty of machine ethics, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 21, 4, pp. 18-21, (2006); Human Computer Interaction Handbook, (2003); Ethical IT Innovation A Value Based System Design Approach, (2016); Shilton, Katie, Values Levers: Building Ethics into Design, Science Technology and Human Values, 38, 3, pp. 374-397, (2013); Formalism in Ethics and Non Formal Ethics of Values, (1973); Acquisti, Alessandro, Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, Science, 347, 6221, pp. 509-514, (2015); Hanson, Vicki L., ACM's commitment to accessibility, Communications of the ACM, 60, 3, (2017); Security Engineering A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, (2001); Spiekermann-Hoff, Sarah, Engineering privacy, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 35, 1, pp. 67-82, (2009); Cavoukian, Ann, Privacy by Design: Origins, meaning, and prospects for assuring privacy and trust in the information era, pp. 170-208, (2011)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","00189219; 15582256","","IEEPA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053323780"

Corporate Safety Security Health and Environment (SSHE) initially developed and implemented the Environmental Performance Reporting System (EPRS) for all operating assets and official issued the Environmental Performance Reporting (EPR) Procedure in the later time At the beginning the environmental data were manually consolidated, calculated, summarized and reported through excel spreadsheet format and input into mother company SSHE Performance Database by each assigned asset representative. Pain points from users which were 1) Working with number of excel spreadsheets; 2) Wasting time with duplicate data input, email notification and comfirmation process; 3) Using of invalid factors or coefficient; 4) Lacking of data security control; 5) Unspecified of role and responsibility for report preparation, review and approval; and 6) Limiting of storage space of individual computer were often raised and discussed. To solve all pain points above, the development of EPRS was brought into the consideration. The goal was to establish an effective and efficient reporting system that is user-friendly, easily accessible, permanent database storage, calculate the output and provides summarized data. Initially, the purchasing of additional functions in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software was contacted to propose the quotation. The quotation with huge cost was proposed for developing the EPRS. Due to oil price crisis PTTEP promoted an encouraged the save to be safe program. Consequently In-house development of Web-based EPRS application has been initiated and innovated in order to solve and close out all pain points raised by relevant parties. The development of application with supporting by company group digital team has been completed and Go-Live in September 2018. The functions provided in application cover the generation of asset environmental performance report, analysis report as well as system synchronization. Furthermore the application helps reducing man-hour of projects and corporate personnel that equivalent to save budget of 46,200 USD per year. Finally this paper indicates how technology with innovation can be used to reduce double works and improve the quality of reporting in terms of completeness, consistency, accuracy as well as monitor the environmental performance.

The qualitative research approach employed a series of exploratory practitioner-based interviews guided by Grounded Theory methodology to examine the technology barriers and challenges faced by the non-profit sector. The findings revealed some inspirational exemplars of practice but also found that a comprehensive transformation of the sector facilitated by emerging technologies remains outstanding, frustrated by challenges including limited funding, resource constraints, skills gaps, donor reporting requirements and sectoral tendencies to 'reinvent the wheel'. The practitioner interviews also highlighted discontinuities and a lack of synergy between the digital transformation ambitions of the sector and the Corporate Social Responsibility programmes of the technology sector.","Artificial Intelligence; Digital Transformation; Non-profit Organisations; Artificial Intelligence; Profitability; Social Aspects; Corporate Social Responsibilities (csr); Digital Transformation; Emerging Technologies; Non-profit; Qualitative Research; Resource Constraint; Technology Barriers; Technology Industry; Nonprofit Organization","Artificial intelligence; Profitability; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Digital transformation; Emerging technologies; Non-profit; Qualitative research; Resource Constraint; Technology barriers; Technology industry; Nonprofit organization","","Irish Computer Society Practitioner Briefing, (2019); Wheel A Portrait of Ireland S Non Profit Sector; Charities 2037; Burt, Eleanor, New technologies, embedded values, and strategic change: Evidence from the U.K. voluntary sector, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 32, 1, pp. 115-127, (2003); Carnochan, Sarah, Performance Measurement Challenges in Nonprofit Human Service Organizations, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 43, 6, pp. 1014-1032, (2014); Jaskyte, Kristina, Predictors of Administrative and Technological Innovations in Nonprofit Organizations, Public Administration Review, 71, 1, pp. 77-86, (2011); Volkoff, Olga, Critical realism and affordances: Theorizing IT-associated organizational change processes, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 3, pp. 819-834, (2013); Journal of the Association for Information Systems, (2008); Collins, Karina, Strategy, leadership and team building, pp. 239-263, (2018); Weill, Peter, Is your company ready for a digital future?, MIT Sloan Management Review, 59, 2, pp. 21-25, (2018)","Curry, E.; Keane, M.; Ojo, A.; Salwala, D.","CEUR-WS ceurws@sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081547267"

It involves a transformation in corporate communication management and social responsibility practices, which borrows from those of social movements to contribute to the social production of identity of citizen-consumers. This corporate political shift involves the use of messages, slogans and content based on final (of common interest) or instrumental (linked to the industry in which they are applied) political values. Political behaviour does not operate in a vacuum but is the response to a change in values of the young generations employing digital technologies and demanding a different behaviour from global firms. However, these political advertising practices have been heavily criticised in the field of political economy, insofar as it is contended that they are impostures lacking authenticity. Thus, 45 campaigns were analysed to determine the characteristics of brand activism in this new socio-political context. From the results it follows that this activist practice, of Anglo-Saxon origin, is a relevant trend in political communication because it aligns individual identity, the management of public assets and corporate action in the political sphere.","Authenticity; Brand Activism; Campaign; Consumer-citizen; Corporate Diplomacy; Corporate Political Shift; Environment; Identity","","","Relaciones Publicas 2 0, (2013); Achrol, Ravi S., Marketing in the network economy, Journal of Marketing, 63, SUPPL., pp. 146-163, (1999); Altman, Barbara W., Corporate community relations in the 1990s: A study in transformation, Business and Society, 37, 2, pp. 221-227, (1998); What is Globalization, (2000); Brand Activism Working Toward Progressive Representations of Social Movements in Advertising, (2018); Politics Products and Markets Exploring Political Consumerism Past and Present, (2004); Malaga Instituto De Investigacion En Relaciones Publicas Iirp, (2013); Capriotti, Paul V., Corporate citizenship and public relations: The importance and interactivity of social responsibility issues on corporate websites, Public Relations Review, 33, 1, pp. 84-91, (2007); Business and Society Ethics and Stakeholder Management, (1989); Carroll, William K., Democratic media activism through the lens of social movement theory, Media, Culture and Society, 28, 1, pp. 83-145, (2006)","","Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Navarra","23867876; 02140039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076979911"

In addition to discovering the positive impacts, multidisciplinary research about ethical concerns related to artificial intelligence should take place. The rise of AI ethics sets new questions for management studies. New ethical demands drive organizations to introduce new practices, routines, and roles. In recent years the AI ethics community has focused on the principle-level work resulting in manifold documentation. It is a crucial task for management studies to convert these findings into organizational practices. A part of management studies’ task is to answer who should take responsibility for the ethical queries. Role-specific, systematic and agency-based approaches offer different views on organizational roles and practices to this ethical challenge. Arguing from the role-specific approach, the emerging roles of AI ethics could build-up to the boundaries between programmers, designers, and compliance personnel. The article presents a limited interview data to support future research.

This is a result of the high market prospects from several industries (notably the automotive) as well as LiDAR being a key enabling technology for automation. We will drive along the current two main avenues of LiDAR, targeted to autonomous driving. We will stop at minute technicalities of LiDAR implementations. However, occasionally we will also rise high, to get an eagle-eye view of the bigger picture. We discuss why there will not happen a one-single-expensive-LiDAR-fits-all-scenarios and why a several-cheap-complementary-LiDARs alternative is more rational. We discuss several aspects in which LiDAR changed our understanding of the landscape as well as the high impact it will have in society (economic and quality of life). Automotive LiDAR comes in an age where the societal focus is changing from private ownership to pay-as-you-use-services, and where personal responsibility will be gradually replaced by corporate liability.

This structure obfuscates the networks, channels, and flows of communication between employers, workers, nongovernmental organizations and other vested intermediaries, creating a lack of transparency. Factories operate far from the brands themselves, often in developing countries where labor is cheap and regulations are weak. However, the emergence of social media and mobile technology has drawn the world closer together. Specifically, crowdsourcing is being used in an innovative way to gather feedback from outsourced laborers with access to digital platforms. This article examines how crowdsourcing platforms are used for both gathering and sharing information to foster accountability. We critically assess how these tools enable dialogue between brands and factory workers, making workers part of the greater conversation. We argue that although there are challenges in designing and implementing these new monitoring systems, these platforms can pave the path for new forms of unionization and corporate social responsibility beyond just rebranding.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Crowdsourcing; Digital Unions; Labor; New Media Technology; Outsourced Labor; Transparency","","","Can Transparency in Supply Chains Advance Labor Rights Mapping of Existing Efforts, (2016); Arora, Payal, Slumdog romance: Facebook love and digital privacy at the margins, Media, Culture and Society, 39, 3, pp. 408-422, (2017); Analysis in Qualitative Research, (2010); Brabham, Daren C., Crowdsourcing as a model for problem solving: An introduction and cases, Convergence, 14, 1, pp. 75-90, (2008); Brabham, Daren C., Crowdsourcing the public participation process for planning projects, Planning Theory, 8, 3, pp. 242-262, (2009); Chen, Feng, Between the state and labour: The conflict of Chinese trade unions' double identity in market reform, China Quarterly, 176, pp. 1006-1028, (2003); Nation, (2017); Impact of Supply Chain Transparency on Sustainability Under Ngo Scrutiny, (2015); Global Media Journal, (2011); Laborvoices Where Startups and Progress Meet, (2014)","","University of Southern California info@ijoc.org","19328036","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074048508"

At a broad level, I explore how the neoliberal privatization of the telecommunications industry has involved a reconfiguration of corporate-state relations rather than an erasure of the state in corporate discourse. I trace how Telefónica accrues currency as a digital pioneer and provider of a social good by incorporating consumers, state actors, and other corporations into its moral apparatus. My point of entry is a smartphone application that the company's Colombian subsidiary developed and subsequently gamified to empower consumer-citizens to end street-based child labor. Within a digital economy of “instant gratification” and national context of securitization, the process whereby consumers are interpellated as citizen-activists highlights the thin line between profiling techniques and humanitarian action, and between surveillance and activism, while disguising the limits of the state bureaucracy and the company's own distance from its purported beneficiaries. Ultimately, I show how the company maintained its narrative about its innovative and sustainable commitment to children even when explaining the failures of its CSR strategy.

This paper presents a case study of a small company producing digital albums that launched a digital communication campaign aiming to increase the habits of taking and printing digital photos. The campaign also aimed at creating a more positive image about Portugal's future in a financial crisis context and increasing tourism activities and a sense of national self-esteem among people. The campaign 'Portugal, the best destination' invited everyone in Portugal to show the country as a tourist destination of excellence, participating with photos that would be added to the largest photo book recognised by The Guinness World of Records. The buzz created by such a low budget campaign solved the organisation's lack of awareness and the lack of photography printing routines among consumers, while bringing a Portuguese sense of pride and helping create an external public opinion about the country.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Destination Marketing; Integrated Marketing Communications; New Media; Societal Marketing","","In order to increase awareness, reputation and business sales, this case study illustrates the social responsibility campaign developed by Dreambooks® in 2012 and its activation in 2016. The context of financial crisis in Portugal, which began in 2008 and had its peak in 2011 and 2012 with the support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, led to a lack of national self-esteem. This resulted in an increase of emigration and unemployment rates and the country being rated as ‘rubbish’ by the rating agencies. Especially young people were also suspicious about future opportunities. In 2012, Dreambooks® saw an opportunity for a societal marketing campaign with the purpose of changing the population’s attitudes and behaviours of neglecting their own country and overvaluing foreign nations. This attitude change would be critical to create a confident generation that believed in a better future for the country and was willing to invest in it: living, studying, working or creating entrepreneurial projects in Portugal. The place attachment to the country would be key for creating nationals’ loyalty and for them to recommend the country to foreign visitors (Gross and Brown, 2008). It would also have a social and economic impact by increasing tourism and would lead to a value co-creation of a national brand (Shams and Lombardi, 2016).","Ahmed, Allam, Entrepreneurship, management, and sustainable development, World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development, 1, 1, pp. 6-30, (2005); Amran, Azlan Bin, Corporate Social Reporting in Malaysia: An institutional perspective, World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development, 3, 1, pp. 20-36, (2007); Ashley, Christy, Creative Strategies in Social Media Marketing: An Exploratory Study of Branded Social Content and Consumer Engagement, Psychology and Marketing, 32, 1, pp. 15-27, (2015); Brodie, Roderick J., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Carlson, Ashley, Followership and social media marketing, Academy of Marketing Studies Journal, 19, 1, pp. 80-101, (2015); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate social responsibility: Evolution of a definitional construct, Business and Society, 38, 3, pp. 268-295, (1999); Christofi, Michael, Cause-related marketing and strategic agility: An integrated framework for gaining the competitive advantage, World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development, 9, 4, pp. 518-542, (2013); Management Accounting Quarterly, (2012); Dana, Léo Paul, Expanding the scope of methodologies used in entrepreneurship research, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 2, 1, pp. 79-88, (2005); Dana, Léo Paul, Qualitative research revisited: Epistemology of a comprehensive approach, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 26, 2, pp. 154-170, (2015)","","Inderscience Publishers","17460581; 17460573","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063460862"

A strong, positive reputation must be built in many years, while it can be damaged relatively quickly. There are many threats to reputation that in the current digital era are multiplied by the development of the Internet and social media. Therefore, the importance and need for the effective reputation risk management is growing, which, however, is a very difficult challenge for managers. In this paper, it was demonstrated that the dilemmas of reputation risk management stem from the complex, emotional, and rational structure as well as from the qualitative character of reputation, which generates difficulties in identifying the causes and sources of its threats. The qualitative character of reputation risk, fuzzy responsibility for reputation, and its protection as well as a lack of proper methods and tools to measure the reputation risk—these are the main problems that hinder the formulation of the acceptable concepts of reputation risk management and their implementation into practice.","Corporate Reputation; Reputation Risk; Risk Management; Stakeholders","","","Risk Intelligence Series, (2011); Aula, Pekka, Social media, reputation risk and ambient publicity management, Strategy and Leadership, 38, 6, pp. 43-49, (2010); Barnett, Michael L., Corporate Reputation: The Definitional Landscape, Corporate Reputation Review, 9, 1, pp. 26-38, (2006); Enhancements to the Basel II Framework, (2009); Radically Transparent Monitoring and Managing Reputations Online, (2008); Berens, Guido A.J.M., Corporate Associations in the Academic Literature: Three Main Streams of Thought in the Reputation Measurement Literature, Corporate Reputation Review, 7, 2, pp. 161-178, (2004); Bergh, Donald D., New frontiers of the reputation-performance relationship: Insights from multiple theories, Journal of Management, 36, 3, pp. 620-632, (2010); Boyd, Brian K., Reconsidering the reputation-performance relationship: A resource-based view, Journal of Management, 36, 3, pp. 588-609, (2010); Corporate Reputation Perspectives of Measuring and Managing A Principal Risk, (2007); Focussed Quality Managing for Results, (1994)","","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

Therefore, a quantitative study explores the owner-managers’ attitudes on digital media. The methodology integrates measures from technological innovation and corporate social responsibility to understand the rationale for using online media to communicate about sustainable and responsible tourism management. The results have indicated that there is a positive and significant relationship between the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of digital media (for the promotion of sustainable behaviours and stakeholder engagement). This contribution suggests that communication of responsible tourism management is more effective when it is offered through interactive channels. It implies that there are opportunities for hospitality businesses to enhance their reputation and image as they engage in interactive communications with different stakeholders.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr Measures; Digital Media; Hospitality; Online Communication; Pace Of Technological Innovation; Responsible Tourism Management; Technology Acceptance Model","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association and Malta Tourism Authority.

All the sensors and data gathering engines over the years have inevitably created so-called 'big data,' with changes in data generation creating new filing, storage, and access requirements with more to come. The move to Open Data access has made these data available to all, but these new sources of knowledge and decision support have not been exploited purposefully by many corporations. The needs of the environment and human societies must not be forgotten, but seem to be increasingly subsumed by the frenetic scramble to monetize data and information for profit. Destruction of the environment and resulting species extinctions are ongoing as well as damages caused by misuse of personal data. Here, we discuss the costs of corporate neglect of social, environmental and economic responsibility for the sake of unrelenting profit. Usually a discussion of costs ends with the bottom line, hopefully in the black, which is the first bottom line 'Profit'. We are arguing for the conversation to include other bottom lines, i.e. the community or 'People' and the environment or 'Planet.'

For better or for worse, these forms of network hospitality are transforming the hospitality landscape, with critical repercussions for home owners, residential neighbourhoods, local economies, urban planners and company investors and executives. These stakeholders often frame their discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of network hospitality in scalar terms. The article begins by analysing the discursive construction of spatial scales, spanning from the private enclaves of hosts' homes, to the public spaces of neighbourhoods and cities, to the global imaginary implied in Airbnb's motto 'Belong Anywhere'. It then asks how temporal and digital scales are also invoked in discourse about Airbnb, and with what ethical and political implications. Drawing on scholarly research, newspaper articles and corporate marketing materials, the analysis reflects critically on how scale is deployed to assert power, assign moral responsibility, and make claims to belonging in the context of network hospitality.","Airbnb; Collaborative Economy; Digital Platforms; Ethics; Network Hospitality; Politics Of Scale","","","Strange Encounters Embodied Others in Post Coloniality, (2000); Airbnb Introduces the Belo, (2014); Never A Stranger, (2015); Airbnb A New Resource for Middle Class Families, (2015); About Us, (2004); We Accept, (2017); Airbnb S Positive Economic Impact in Cities Around the World; Aramberri, Julio, The host should get lost: Paradigms in the tourism theory, Annals of Tourism Research, 28, 3, pp. 738-761, (2001); El Turisme Mata Els Barris, (2017); Sharing Economy and Housing Affordability Evidence from Airbnb, (2018)","","Intellect Ltd. info@intellectbooks.com","20427921; 20427913","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057954114"

Nowadays, CSR is less constrained to define itself as ethically oriented concept, when it is aligned with marketing strategies. Though there are advantages and beneficial aspects of using both CSR and Marketing to promote competitive advantage, the combinations of the above two are different etymologies, which always don't go along with each other in this technological world. As the technology plumps up, the CSR communication and implementation patterns grown up from manual to machine; then machine to modern software application. However companies frame CSR ideologies according to current digital era to integrate with their business strategies to amplify their brand image and identity. In this article, the author reviews various literatures to argument with the causes and positive and negative effects of integrating CSR concept into marketing strategies while keeping the purpose of CSR unaltered. The findings show that there is some negativity and contradictions of using ethically responsible and social actions for the purpose of branding and marketing.","Business Strategy; Competitive Advantage; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Marketing","","","Three Strategies for Integrating Csr with Brand Marketing, (2004); Brown, Tom J., The company and the product: Corporate associations and consumer product responses, Journal of Marketing, 61, 1, pp. 68-84, (1997); Timothy Coombs, W.

Online gambling industry usually provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) meant mainly to enable third-party applications to network with their gambling services and enhance a user's gambling experience. In this industrial practice and experience paper, we advocate that such API's can also be used to retrieve gamblers' online data, such as browsing and betting history, promotions and available offers and use it to build more intel-ligent and proactive responsible gambling information systems. We report on our industrial experience in this field and make the argument that data available for persuasive marketing and usability should, under specific usage conditions, also be made available for responsible gambling information systems. This principle would provide equal opportunities for both directions. We discuss the psychological foundations of our proposed solution and the risks and challenges typically found when building such a software-assisted intervention, persuasion and emotion regulation technology. We also shed light on its potential implications from the perspectives of social corporate responsibility and data protection. We finally propose a conceptual architecture to demonstrate our vision and explain how it can be implemented.

This trend is prominently motivated by the use of ICTs by terrorist groups as a tool for recruitment, financing, and planning operations. States and international organizations have long called for enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors to aid efforts to counter terrorism and violent extremism. However, as the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression noted in his latest report to the Human Rights Council, 'the intersection of State behaviour and corporate roles in the digital age remains somewhat new for many States'. Detailed information on the means and modalities of content control exercised by online platforms is scarce. Terms of service and community standards are commonly drafted in terms that do not provide sufficiently clear guidance on the circumstances under which content may be blocked, removed or restricted, or access to a service may be restricted or terminated. Users have limited possibilities to challenge decisions to restrict material or access to a service. Moreover, as private bodies, such platforms are generally subject to limited democratic or independent oversight. At the same time, having private actors such as social media companies increasingly undertake traditionally public interest tasks in the context of Internet governance is likely unavoidable, as public authorities frequently lack the human or technical resources to satisfactorily perform these tasks. Against this background, this paper aims to examine ways to define the contours of the division of responsibilities in countering terrorism and violent extremism between the public and private spheres. It addresses ways to ensure that Internet intermediaries carry out quasi-enforcement and quasi-adjudicative tasks in a manner compliant with international human rights norms and standards.","Freedom Of Expression; Human Rights; Internet Intermediaries; Terrorism; Violent Extremism; Social Aspects; Community Standards; Freedom Of Expression; Human Rights; International Organizations; Internet Governance; Public And Private Sector; Third-party Content; Violent Extremism; Terrorism","Social aspects; Community standards; freedom of expression; Human rights; International organizations; Internet governance; Public and private sector; Third-party content; violent extremism; Terrorism","This work was supported by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/ M010236/1].","Top 20 Valuable Facebook Statistics, (2017); You Know What S Cool A Billion Hours, (2017); Global Social Media Research Summary 2016, (2016); When the Internet Officially Became the Public Square, (2017); US Supreme Court Just Ruled that Using Social Media is A Constitutional Right, (2017); 62 of U S Adults Get their News from Social Media Says Report, (2016); Social Media Outstrips Tv as News Source for Young People, (2016); Twitter to the Rescue how Social Media is Transforming Human Rights Monitoring, (2013); Rioters Use of Social Media Throws Telecoms Firms into Spotlight, (2011); Shirky, Clay, The political power of social media: Technology, the public sphere, and political change, Foreign Affairs, 90, 1, pp. 28-41, (2011)","Minarik, T.; Lindstrom, L.; Jakschis, R.","NATO CCD COE Publications help@computer.org","23255374; 23255366","9789949990467; 9789916978924; 9789949954421; 9789949954483; 9789949990405; 9789916978948; 9789916978900; 9789949990429; 9789949954407; 9789949990443","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050904651"

The study builds and tests a theoretical model that conceptually links the dialogic theory framework with the concept of CSP in management. Using the KLD CSP dataset, the study constructed a sample of S&P 500 petro-chemical companies (N = 106) with four levels of corporate environmental responsibility performance (green, gray, toxic, and neutral). The findings provided empirical evidence that green companies were more likely to facilitate dialogic communication with stakeholders.

But while it might appear that any internet user can publish freely and instantly online, many platforms actively curate the content posted by their users. How and why these platforms operate to moderate speech is largely opaque. This Article provides the first analysis of what these platforms are actually doing to moderate online speech under a regulatory and First Amendment framework. Drawing from original interviews, archived materials, and internal documents, this Article describes how three major online platforms - Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube - moderate content and situates their moderation systems into a broader discussion of online governance and the evolution of free expression values in the private sphere. It reveals that private content-moderation systems curate user content with an eye to American free speech norms, corporate responsibility, and the economic necessity of creating an environment that reflects the expectations of their users. In order to accomplish this, platforms have developed a detailed system rooted in the American legal system with regularly revised rules, trained human decisionmaking, and reliance on a system of external influence. This Article argues that to best understand online speech, we must abandon traditional doctrinal and regulatory analogies and understand these private content platforms as systems of governance. These platforms are now responsible for shaping and allowing participation in our new digital and democratic culture, yet they have little direct accountability to their users. Future intervention, if any, must take into account how and why these platforms regulate online speech in order to strike a balance between preserving the democratizing forces of the internet and protecting the generative power of our New Governors.","","","","N Y Times, (2016); undefined; N Y Times, (2016); Facebook, (2016); undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; undefined; STAR TRIB, (2016)","","Harvard Law Review Association mail@wshein.com","0017811X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042588465"

While corporations and governments claim holistic care and responsibility for environment in their publications, how is this accounted for and assured across assets portfolios? In the age of transparency, stock market analysts and the financial industry are seeking non-financial metrics as indicators for sustainable business profitability. Maintenance and improvement of ecosystem functioning is fundamental to the sustainability of eco resources and value increase, while progressive deterioration (due to pollution erosion, loss and fragmentation) will devalue assets. The advent of ""big data"" in this global digital age opens up powerful new opportunities to investigate remotely the health status of environmental resources processes, over wide geographic areas. By smart integration of technologies and systematic ""ground truthing"" in critical areas, GIS linked data bases provide a powerful platform to evaluate the status of Eco services and the economic and wider value of eco services. A critique of the cutting edge techniques and future applications will be presented together with opportunities to share and unlock development barriers. The development of such tools provide a penetrating insight into the stewardship of land, coastal and marine resources and ""live"" metrics of changing values. Transparency demands around the globe will lead to government to holds companies accountable for stewardship of national assets. Both the public and private sectors will be increasingly required to maintain proper records of the value of environmental assets, and rectify losses or deteriorations. Cutting edge insights into key sectors (finance, insurance, energy, shipping) will highlight how such data could be applied to benchmarking, assessing risks of future activities and the distillation of the financial exposure from legacy assets and pollution events. Ultimately, when owners finally decide to divest or undertake mergers and acquisitions past stewardship will feature in environmental due diligence, the bottom line and global reputation. Today, multinational companies (from a wide spectrum of industries) play a significant role in shaping the environmental guardianship of the planet's resources. Scientifically sound corporate reporting including the eco services balance sheet (with defined debt and profit) need to be standardised, in order to be truly valuable in responsible decision making. Furthermore, our understanding of ecological capacity, robustness and the criticality of thresholds (which may cause irreversible change) need to be expanded.","Big Data; Commerce; Cutting Tools; Decision Making; Deterioration; Distillation; Finance; Health; Marine Biology; Marine Engineering; Pollution; Profitability; Risk Assessment; Social Aspects; Transparency; Big Data Applications; Ecosystem Functioning; Environmental Resources; Environmental Services; Irreversible Changes; Multi-national Companies; Public And Private Sector; Sustainable Business; Sustainable Development","Big data; Commerce; Cutting tools; Decision making; Deterioration; Distillation; Finance; Health; Marine biology; Marine engineering; Pollution; Profitability; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Transparency; Big data applications; Ecosystem functioning; Environmental resources; Environmental services; Irreversible changes; Multi-national companies; Public and private sector; Sustainable business; Sustainable development","","ESA Climate Change Initiative; Corporate Social Responsibility, (2011); undefined; United Nations Global Pulse Home; United Nations Environment Program World Conservation Monitoring; Approach for Reporting on Ecosystem Services, (2011); Marr, Bernard, BIG DATA IN PRACTICE: HOW 45 SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES USED BIG DATA ANALYTICS TO DELIVER EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS, pp. 1-308, (2016); Sustainabilitys Strategic Worth Mckinsey Global Survey Results, (2014); Ecosystems and Human Well Being Synthesis, (2005); undefined","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","","9781613995914","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088065582"

Given the empirical research data (sociological survey) on the Ukrainian food processing companies, the article analyzes stakeholder engagement to replace traditional activities of the company's management and personnel in the reputation management system. As a result, the author's hypothesis was proved that the natural development (increasing the maturity level) of the Reputation Management System (RMS) takes place towards a gradual transfer of reputation management functions from managers to enterprise stakeholders, that is, the traditional reputation activity of the company's management and personnel is being replaced by stakeholder engagement. It is also proved that the level of development of the reputation management organizational system (organizational preconditions) should be high, but aimed not so much at ensuring the activity of the enterprise management and personnel to maintain its reputation, but rather at the involving stakeholders' delegated to manage the company reputation. It was found that the prioritizing stakeholder engagement over traditional reputation management activities at the Ukrainian food processing companies is in its infancy. The target state of the reputation management system, where stakeholder engagement is a priority over management activities, was found only in two enterprises out of 18 studied; in 11 of them, these two parameters are balanced, and in remaining five, traditional activity outwalks engagement. The results of the study of the organizational prerequisites for reputation management among enterprises preferring stakeholder engagement show that they have the following seven elements: 1) internal experts in filling and supporting the corporate website and the enterprise pages and brands on social networks; 2) corporate media editorial/text writers among enterprise staff members; 3) a specialized PR unit (reputation management department); 4) the reputation management business process is regulated; 5) the functional responsibilities of the reputation management participants are integrated with the job descriptions of the relevant employees; 6) a documented formalized PR strategy and operational plans for PR work in various time horizons; 7) a documented formalized plan of anti-crisis PR activities. The above elements make it possible to provide recommendations on the reputation management planning for enterprises seeking to take stakeholder engagement advantages in reputation management.","Indirect Reputation Management; Managing Corporate Reputation; Organizational Preconditions; Reputation; Reputational Risks","","","Anbarasan, Periyasami, Stakeholder Engagement in Sustainable Enterprise: Evolving a Conceptual Framework, and a Case Study of ITC, Business Strategy and the Environment, 27, 3, pp. 282-299, (2018); Planning and Control Systems A Framework for Analysis, (1965); Aula, Pekka, Meshworked reputation: Publicists' views on the reputational impacts of online communication, Public Relations Review, 37, 1, pp. 28-36, (2011); Benn, Shaun, Reducing reputational risk: Evaluating stakeholder salience and prioritising stakeholder claims, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 34, 6, pp. 828-842, (2016); Blackburn, Nivea, Stakeholder engagement in corporate reporting: towards building a strong reputation, Marketing Intelligence and Planning, 36, 4, pp. 484-497, (2018); Brodie, Roderick J., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Cho, Moonhee, Communicating corporate social responsibility on social media: Strategies, stakeholders, and public engagement on corporate facebook, Business and Professional Communication Quarterly, 80, 1, pp. 52-69, (2017); Clark, Anna Fountain, Bach, Beethoven, and benefactors: Facebook engagement between symphonies and their stakeholders, International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, 21, 2, pp. 96-108, (2016); Desai, Vinit M., Collaborative stakeholder engagement: An integration between theories of organizational legitimacy and learning, Academy of Management Journal, 61, 1, pp. 220-244, (2018); Dijkmans, Corné, A stage to engage: Social media use and corporate reputation, Tourism Management, 47, pp. 58-67, (2015)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","17277051; 18105467","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058165961"

It is important during this period that the structural integrity is efficiently managed to ensure continuous and safe operation. Increased use of enhanced oil and gas recovery means it is likely that many existing installations will remain operational for a significant period beyond the original design life. The operator needs to capture, evaluate and, if necessary, mitigate design premise changes which inevitably occur during the life of a structure. Further, advances in knowledge and technology may imply changes in codes and standards as well as in analysis methodologies. Changes in corporate structures, transfer of operator responsibility and retirement of experienced engineers call for reliable means to transfer historical data and experience to new stakeholders. Effective emergency preparedness capabilities, structural integrity assessments and inspection planning presuppose that as-is analysis models and corresponding information are easily accessible. This paper presents an implementation of the in-service integrity management process described in the new revision of NORSOK standard N-005 for a large fleet of jackets at the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The process, comprising management of design premise changes as well as state-of-the-art technical solutions over a range of disciplines, has enabled the operator to prolong the service life with decades at minimum investments. A structure integrity management system (SIMS) has been developed and digitized over years and streamlined to meet the needs and challenges in the operation and management of the jacket platforms. SIMS enables a rather lean organization to control the structural integrity status of all load-bearing structures at any time. Platform reinforcements and modifications along with other operational risk reducing measures like unman the platforms in severe storms enable continued use with the same level of safety as for new manned platforms. Advanced analyses are used to document regulatory compliance. Modern fatigue and reliability based inspection planning analyses have reduced the costs needed for inspection of fatigue cracks significantly. The benefits from the SIMS system are substantial and the resulting safety and productivity gains are apparent. The continuity of knowledge and experience is maintained, reducing risk to safety and regularity. The digital transformation related to management of structural integrity status as described in NORSOK standard N-005 is realized through SIMS.","Arctic Engineering; Drilling Platforms; Enhanced Recovery; Fatigue Of Materials; Fleet Operations; Inspection; Investments; Offshore Gas Fields; Offshore Oil Well Production; Offshore Oil Wells; Productivity; Regulatory Compliance; Risk Assessment; Safety Engineering; Storms; Structural Integrity; Digital Transformation; Emergency Preparedness; Knowledge And Experience; Loadbearing Structure; Norwegian Continental Shelves; Operation And Management; Reliability Based Inspections; Structural Integrity Assessment; Structural Design","Arctic engineering; Drilling platforms; Enhanced recovery; Fatigue of materials; Fleet operations; Inspection; Investments; Offshore gas fields; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Productivity; Regulatory compliance; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Storms; Structural integrity; Digital transformation; Emergency preparedness; Knowledge and experience; Loadbearing structure; Norwegian continental shelves; Operation and management; Reliability based inspections; Structural integrity assessment; Structural design","","In Service Integrity Management of Structures and Marine Systems, (2017); User Manual, (2016); Regulations Relating to Health Safety and the Environment in the Petroleum Activities and at Certain Onshore Facilities Framework Regulations, (2016); Regulations Related to Management and the Duty to Provide Information in the Petroleum Activities and at Certain Onshore Facilities the Management Regulations, (2016); Principles for Barrier Management in the Petroleum Industry Barrier Memorandum 2017; Nytt Barrierenotat, (2017); Gibson, Richard S., Bias and uncertainty in the estimation of extreme wave heights and crests, Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE, 2, pp. 363-373, (2009); Estimation of Long Term Extreme Waves from Storm Statistics and Initial Distribution Approach, (2009); Actions and Action Effects, (2017); Integrity of Offshore Structures, (2012)","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) infocentral@asme.org","","9780791884355; 9780791844915; 9780791886861; 9780791885932; 9780791885949; 9780791856598; 9780791856529; 9780791857786; 9780791836125; 9780791887783","PIOSE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055516019"

IT has advanced tools and applications to execute the business plans very effectively which can leave the lasting footprints on the society, and also be helpful in increasing profits, enhancing the workplace, creating transformations for the disabled employees, creating educational opportunities that can bridge the digital divide, improving the business ethics and helping the society. CSR has become an integral part of the organizations which are involving all their stakeholders as beneficiaries and India is the first country to have the mandated CSR regulations. The present study has made an attempt to study the impact of CSR Regulations and technology on the CSR disclosures of the Indian Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) having Maharatna Status. For this purpose, Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure Index (CSRDI) developed by Charumathi & Padmaja, 2015 was adopted for measuring the level of CSR disclosure and Corporate Information and Communication Technology Usage Index (CICTI) was developed and used to measure the level of IT usage. This study used secondary data. Using manual content analysis, the required data for (a) CSR Disclosures were collected from the annual reports of Maharatna companies and (b) CICT usage were collected from the web portals, recruitment portals, social media, news articles, CSR news by Maharatna companies and other digital sources. The sample for the study includes seven Maharatna CPSEs and the period of the study is six years ranging from 2011-12 to 2016-17. Using paired t test, it is found that there is a significant difference in CSR disclosures during pre and post-regulatory periods. CSR disclosures of Maharatna companies significantly increased post-CSR regulatory period. Using multiple regression analysis, it is found that there is a positive and significant relationship between the ICT usage and the CSR disclosures of Maharatna companies.","Central Public Sector Enterprises; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr Disclosure Index; Information Communication Technology; Maharatna Companies","","","Bhatia, Aparna, Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure by SENSEX Companies in India, Management and Labour Studies, 39, 1, pp. 1-17, (2014); Academy of Management Review, (1979); Carroll, Archie B., The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders, Business Horizons, 34, 4, pp. 39-48, (1991); Carroll, Archie B., Corporate social responsibility: Evolution of a definitional construct, Business and Society, 38, 3, pp. 268-295, (1999); Indian Journal of Research, (2015); Implications of Companies Act 2013 Corporate Social Responsibility, (2013); Abrego-Almazán, Demian, Influence of information systems on organizational results, Contaduria y Administracion, 62, 2, pp. 321-338, (2017); Perceived Usefulness Ease of Use and Usage of Information Technology A Replication, (2018); Dpe Csr Guidelines, (2012); Gamerschlag, Ramin, Determinants of voluntary CSR disclosure: Empirical evidence from Germany, Review of Managerial Science, 5, 2, pp. 233-262, (2011)","","University of Wollongong ajnrlp@unsw.edu.au","18342019; 18342000","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050358314"

It is the first local public university in Malaysia that provides such service as part of its corporate social responsibility. In this paper, an investigation towards CSR UUMWiFi was conducted with the aim to ascertain the level of awareness, satisfactions, and its importance to the community. To achieve that, a questionnaire survey (via printed and online) were conducted and distributed within the Sintok-Changlon areas. A total of 424 usable responses were collected through simple random sampling. Data from the questionnaire were analysed using several statistical analysis's such descriptive analysis, correlation test, and chi-square test. Findings from the study reveal that majority of the users are Changlun's local residents, particularly the young and well educated group. The service is rank highly in terms of its importance. Nevertheless, the level of satisfaction on the CSR UUMWiFi is still at a moderate level. Interestingly, the gender and level of education have significant relationship with internet browsing activity where female and those with bachelor degree and SPM have higher propensity to use the service. Some improvements and future works were proposed to ensure that the service is more reliable and can help to transform the socio-economic of the community.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Digital Divide; Rural Development; Wireless Network","","","Zhang, Mingliu, Crossing the Digital Divide: Cost-Effective Broadband Wireless Access for Rural and Remote Areas, IEEE Communications Magazine, 42, 2, pp. 99-105, (2004); Martínez Fernández, Andrés, The TUCAN3G project: Wireless technologies for isolated rural communities in developing countries based on 3G small cell deployments, IEEE Communications Magazine, 54, 7, pp. 36-43, (2016); Anand, Abhinav, VillageCell: Cost effective cellular connectivity in rural areas, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 180-189, (2012); Thapa, Devinder, The Role of ICT Actors and Networks in Development: The Case Study of a Wireless Project in Nepal, Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 49, 1, pp. 1-16, (2011); Proc Int Conf Access Networks, (2010); García-Murillo, Martha Garcia, A model of wireless broadband diffusion in Latin America, Telematics and Informatics, 26, 3, pp. 259-269, (2009); LaRose, Robert, Closing the rural broadband gap: Promoting adoption of the Internet in rural America, Telecommunications Policy, 31, 6-7, pp. 359-373, (2007); Bagchi, Kallol Kumar, Factors contributing to global digital divide: Some empirical results, Journal of Global Information Technology Management, 8, 3, pp. 47-65, (2005); International Telecommunication Union, (2005); Kilenthong, Weerachart T., Access to ICT in rural and urban Thailand, Telecommunications Policy, 38, 11, pp. 1146-1159, (2014)","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka isdpr@snu.ac.kr","21801843; 22898131","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046431826"
